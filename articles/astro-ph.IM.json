IACT's are commonly and successfully used in order to search\nand study Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources. Difficulties with\nseparating primary photons from primary hadrons (mostly protons) in Cherenkov\nexperiments become larger at lower energies. I have calculated longitudinal and\nlateral density distributions and their fluctuations at low energies basing on\nMonte Carlo simulations (for vertical gamma cascades and protonic showers) to\ncheck the influence of the detector parameters on the possible measurement.\nRelative density fluctuations are significantly higher in proton than in photon\ninduced showers. Taking into account the limited detector field of view (FOV)\nimplies the changes of these calculated distributions for both types of primary\nparticles and causes an enlargement in relative fluctuations. Absorption due to\nRayleigh and Mie scattering has an impact on mean values but does not change\nrelative fluctuations. The total number of Cherenkov photons is more sensitive\nto the observation height in gamma cascades than in proton showers at low\nprimary energies. The relative fluctuations of the density do not depend on the\nreflector size in the investigated size range (from 240 m^2 up to 960 m^2).\nThis implies that a single telescope with a mirror area larger than that of the\nMAGIC telescope cannot achieve better energy resolution than estimated and\npresented in this paper. The correlations between longitudinal and lateral\ndistributions are much more pronounced for primary gamma-ray than for primary\nproton showers.\n", "authors": "Dorota Sobczynska"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2009-02-02T11:24:07Z", "title": "Carpet-3 - a new experiment to study primary composition around the knee", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0252v1", "summary": "  We propose a new experiment to study primary composition around the knee.

Simple polynomials\nprovide good boundaries in common situations. For data exhibiting a complex\nbehaviour, the use of adaptive splines gives excellent results.

A study has been done through numerical simulations with artificial\npoint sources and archival image of a galaxy from GALEX data archive, to\nexplore the effects of all the above mentioned parameters on the reconstructed\nimages. In particular the issues of angular resolution, photometric accuracy\nand photometric-nonlinearity associated with the intensified CMOS-imager based\nphoton counting detectors have been investigated. The photon events in image\nframes are detected by three different centroid algorithms with some energy\nthresholds.

This versatile and\neasy-to-operate instrument has been used over the past three years for a wide\nvariety of projects. This paper first reviews the basic principles of FP\ntunable filters, then provides a detailed description of the hardware and\nsoftware associated with MMTF and the techniques developed to observe with this\ninstrument and reduce the data. The main lessons learned in the course of the\ncommissioning and implementation of MMTF are highlighted next, before\nconcluding with a brief outlook on the future of MMTF and of similar facilities\nwhich are soon coming on line.\n", "authors": "S.

So far, most studies have considered LAMBDA as a free parameter and\nvarious values or formulae have been proposed without much mathematical\njustification. In this paper, we demonstrate by means of a rigorous calculus\nthat it is possible to define LAMBDA such that the gravitational potential of a\nflat disc coincides at order zero with that of a geometically thin disc of the\nsame surface density.

In contrast, HCDs read pixels with low\npower, on-chip multiplexer electronics in a random access fashion. Faster frame\nrates achieved with multi-output readout design will allow the next\ngeneration's larger effective area telescopes to observe bright sources free of\npileup. Radiation damaged lattice sites effect a single pixel instead of an\nentire row. Random access, multi-output readout will allow for novel readout\nmodes such as simultaneous bright-source-fast/whole-chip-slow readout. In order\nfor HCDs to be useful as X-Ray detectors, they must show noise and energy\nresolution performance similar to CCDs while retaining advantages inherent to\nHCDs. We will report on readnoise, conversion gain, and energy resolution\nmeasurements of an X-Ray enhanced Teledyne HAWAII-1RG (H1RG) HCD and describe\ntechniques of H1RG data reduction.\n", "authors": "Stephen D.

It uses electrical scattering matrices and\nnoise wave vectors to describe receiver architectures of arbitrary topology and\ncomplexity. It differs from existing freely-available software mainly in that\nthe scattering matrices used to describe the receiver and its components are\nanalytic rather than numeric. This allows different types of modeling and\nanalysis of receivers to be performed. Non-ideal behavior of receiver\ncomponents can be parameterized in their scattering matrices. SNS enables the\ninstrument designer to then derive analytic expressions for the signal and\nnoise at the receiver outputs in terms of parameterized component\nimperfections, and predict their contribution to receiver systematic errors\nprecisely. This can drive the receiver design process by, for instance,\nallowing the instrument designer to identify which component imperfections\ncontribute most to receiver systematic errors, and hence place firm\nspecifications on individual components. Using SNS to perform this analysis is\npreferable to traditional Jones matrix-based analysis as it includes internal\nreflections and is able to model noise: two effects which Jones matrix analysis\nis unable to describe. SNS can be used to model any receiver in which the\ncomponents can be described by scattering matrices.

We review some indirect methods for estimating\nangular diameter, using various types of input data. Each diameter estimate,\nobtained for the test-case calibrator star lambda Gru, is compared with the\nvalue 2.71 mas found in the Bord\\'e calibrator catalogue published in 2002.\nMethods. Angular size estimations from spectral type, spectral index, in-band\nmagnitude, broadband photometry, and spectrophotometry give close estimates of\nthe angular diameter, with slightly variable uncertainties. Fits on photometry\nand spectrophotometry need physical atmosphere models with \"plausible\" stellar\nparameters. Angular diameter uncertainties were estimated by means of residual\nbootstrapping confidence intervals. All numerical results and graphical outputs\npresented in this paper were obtained using the routines developed under\nPV-WAVE, which compose the modular software suite SPIDAST, created to calibrate\nand interprete spectroscopic and interferometric measurements, particularly\nthose obtained with VLTI-AMBER. Results. The final angular diameter estimate\n2.70 mas of lambda Gru, with 68% confidence interval 2.65-2.81 mas, is obtained\nby fit of the MARCS model on the ISO-SWS 2.38-27.5 mum spectrum, with the\nstellar parameters T_eff = 4 250 K, log(g) = 2.0, z = 0.0 dex, M = 1.0 M_sun,\nand xi_turb = 2.0 km/s.\n", "authors": "P.

The two main scientific ob jectives, the study of the Milky\nWay diffuse background and the detection of point sources, are complicated by\nthe lack of photons. That is why we need a powerful Poisson noise removal\nmethod on the sphere which is efficient on low count Poisson data. This paper\npresents a new multiscale decomposition on the sphere for data with Poisson\nnoise, called Multi-Scale Variance Stabilizing Transform on the Sphere\n(MS-VSTS). This method is based on a Variance Stabilizing Transform (VST), a\ntransform which aims to stabilize a Poisson data set such that each stabilized\nsample has a quasi constant variance. In addition, for the VST used in the\nmethod, the transformed data are asymptotically Gaussian. MS-VSTS consists of\ndecomposing the data into a sparse multi-scale dictionary like wavelets or\ncurvelets, and then applying a VST on the coefficients in order to get almost\nGaussian stabilized coefficients. In this work, we use the Isotropic\nUndecimated Wavelet Transform (IUWT) and the Curvelet Transform as spherical\nmulti-scale transforms. Then, binary hypothesis testing is carried out to\ndetect significant coefficients, and the denoised image is reconstructed with\nan iterative algorithm based on Hybrid Steepest Descent (HSD). To detect point\nsources, we have to extract the Galactic diffuse background: an extension of\nthe method to background separation is then proposed.

The techniques considered are those that modify signals from\nauxiliary reference antennas to model and cancel interference from an\nastronomical observation. These techniques can be applied in the time domain,\nwhere the RFI voltage is modeled and subtracted from the astronomy signal path\n(adaptive noise canceling), or they can be applied to the autocorrelated and\ncross-correlated voltage spectra in the frequency domain (postcorrelation\ncanceling). For ideal receivers and a single, statistically stationary\ninterfering signal, both precorrelation and postcorrelation filters can result\nin complete cancellation of the interference from the observation. The\npostcorrelation method has the advantage of being applied on tens or hundreds\nof millisecond timescales rather than tens or hundreds of nanosecond\ntimescales. However, this can be a disadvantage if the RFI transmitter location\nis changing, since the cross-correlated power measurements which link the\ninterference power in the astronomy and reference signal paths can decorrelate.\nIf the decorrelation is not too severe, it can be allowed for, at the expense\nof a noise increase. The time domain adaptive cancelers are allowed to slightly\nvary their internal coefficients and adapt to changing phases during the\nintegrations, which means that they avoid the decorrelation problem. However,\nthe freedom to adapt also results in a noise increase. In this paper the\nability of both types of cancelers to excise interference originating from a\nmoving source is compared. The cancelers perform well on both observed and\nsimulated data, giving complete cancellation.\n", "authors": "D. A. Mitchell, J. G.

This tendency is driven by peer\npressure and job market prospects, and is occasionally encouraged by senior\nresearchers. Although the same phenomenon existed in past decades, it is\nalarmingly more prevalent today because a growing fraction of observational and\ntheoretical projects are pursued in large groups with rigid research agendas.\nIn addition, the emergence of a ``standard model'' in cosmology (albeit with\nunknown dark components) offers secure ``bonds'' for a safe investment of\nresearch time. In this short essay, which summarizes a banquet lecture at a\nrecent conference, I give examples for both safe and risky topics in\nastrophysics (which I split into categories of ``bonds,'' ``stocks,'' and\n``venture capital''), and argue that young researchers should always allocate a\nsmall fraction of their academic portfolio to innovative projects with risky\nbut potentially highly profitable returns. In parallel, selection and promotion\ncommittees must find new strategies for rewarding candidates with creative\nthinking.\n", "authors": "Abraham Loeb"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2010-08-11T12:19:59Z", "title": "Fundamental Limitations of Pixel Based Image Deconvolution in Radio\n  Astronomy", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1892v1", "summary": "  Deconvolution is essential for radio interferometric imaging to produce\nscientific quality data because of finite sampling in the Fourier plane.

These fringes are due to an\ninterference phenomenon occurring from straylight effects inside an\ninterferometric instrument. We developed an analytical approach to better\nunderstand this phenomenon when straylight causes crosstalk between beams.\n  We deduced that the parasitic interference significantly affects the\ninterferometric phase and thus the associated observables including the\ndifferential phase and the closure phase. The amount of parasitic flux coupled\nto the piston between beams appears to be very influential in this degradation.\nFor instance, considering a point-like source and a piston ranging from\n$\\lambda/500$ to $\\lambda/5$ in L band ($\\lambda=3.5\\:\\mu$m), a parasitic flux\nof about 1\\% of the total flux produces a parasitic phase reaching at most one\nthird of the intrinsic phase. The piston, which can have different origins\n(instrumental stability, atmospheric perturbations, ...), thus amplifies the\neffect of parasitic interference.\n  According to specifications of piston correction in space or at ground level\n(respectively $\\lambda/500\\approx 2$nm and $\\lambda/30\\approx 100$nm), the\ndetection of hot Jupiter-like planets, one of the most challenging aims for\ncurrent ground-based interferometers, limits parasitic radiation to about 5\\%\nof the incident intensity. This was evaluated by considering different types of\nhot Jupiter synthetic spectra.\n  Otherwise, if no fringe tracking is used, the detection of a typical hot\nJupiter-like system with a solar-like star would admit a maximum level of\nparasitic intensity of 0.01\\% for piston errors equal to $\\lambda$/15. If the\nfringe tracking specifications are not precisely observed, it thus appears that\nthe allowed level of parasitic intensity dramatically decreases and may prevent\nthe detection. In parallel, the calibration of the parasitic phase by a\nreference star, at this accuracy level, seems very difficult. Moreover, since\nparasitic phase is an object-dependent quantity, the use of a hypothetical\nphase abacus, directly giving the parasitic phase from a given parasitic flux\nlevel, is also impossible. Some instrumental solutions, implemented at the\ninstrument design stage for limiting or preventing this parasitic interference,\nappears to be crucial and are presented in this paper.\n", "authors": "Alexis Matter, Bruno Lopez, St\u00e9phane Lagarde, William C.

When\naxial symmetry is broken by the small misalignments of optical elements,\nadditional third-order aberration patterns arise: one each for coma,\nastigmatism and curvature of field and two for distortion. Each of these\nmisalignment patterns is characterized by an associated two-dimensional vector,\neach of which in turn is a linear combination of the tilt and decenter vectors\nof the individual optical elements. For an N-mirror telescope, 2(N-1) patterns\nmust be measured to keep the telescope aligned. Alignment of the focal plane\nmay require two additional patterns. For N = 3, as in a three mirror\nanastigmat, there is a two-dimensional \"subspace of benign misalignment\" over\nwhich the misalignment patterns for third-order coma, astigmatism and curvature\nof field are identically zero. One would need to measure at least one of the\ntwo distortion patterns to keep the telescope aligned. Alternatively, one might\nmeasure one of the fifth-order misalignment patterns, which are derived herein.\nBut the fifth-order patterns are rather insensitive to misalignments, even with\nmoderately wide fields, rendering them of relatively little use in telescope\nalignment. Another alternative would be to use telescope pointing as part of\nthe alignment solution.\n", "authors": "Paul L.

These originate from tensor fluctuations\nof the metric produced during the inflationary phase. Their detection would\ntherefore constitute a major step towards understanding the primordial\nUniverse. The expected level of these anisotropies is however so small that it\nrequires a new generation of instruments with high sensitivity and extremely\ngood control of systematic effects.

Methods: The instrument will directly observe the\nsky through an array of entry horns whose signals will be combined together\nusing an optical combiner. The whole set-up is located inside a cryostat.\nPolarization modulation will be achieved using a rotating half-wave plate and\ninterference fringes will be imaged on two focal planes (separated by a\npolarizing grid) tiled with bolometers. We show that QUBIC can be considered as\na synthetic imager, exactly similar to a usual imager but with a synthesized\nbeam formed by the array of entry horns. Scanning the sky provides an\nadditional modulation of the signal and improve the sky coverage shape. The\nusual techniques of map-making and power spectrum estimation can then be\napplied. We show that the sensitivity of such an instrument is comparable with\nthat of an imager with the same number of horns. We anticipate a low level of\nbeam-related systematics thanks to the fact that the synthesized beam is\ndetermined by the location of the primary horns.

The full detector will comprise 5,160\nphotomultipliers (PMTs) deployed on 86 strings from 1.45-2.45 km deep within\nthe ice. As of the austral summer of 2009-10, 73 out of the total number\nstrings have been deployed, and the detector is reaching its final construction\nphase. A dense sub-array of 6 strings in the center of the detector (DeepCore)\nhas been already installed for enhancing the sensitivity to low energy\nneutrinos. The IceCube de- tection principle is based on the measurement of the\nCherenkov light induced by ultra-relativistic muons and showers produced by\nneutrino interactions in the target matter of the detector. The main scientific\ngoal of the IceCube experiment is the detection of astrophysical neu- trinos\nthat will help to understand and settle the unresolved questions about the\norigin and nature of cosmic rays. In this contribution we will present the\nlatest results of the experiment concerning the search for neutrino point\nsources using the experimental data taken during 2008- 09 where the detector\nwas operated with a 40-string configuration.

Hydrogen masers have\ntraditionally been used as VLBI references, but atmospheric turbulence\ntypically limits (sub) millimeter VLBI coherence times to ~1-30 s. Cryogenic\nSapphire Oscillators (CSO) have better stability than Hydrogen masers on these\ntime scale and are potential alternatives to masers as VLBI references. Here,\nWe describe the design, implementation and tests of a system to produce a 10\nMHz VLBI frequency standard from the microwave (11.2 GHz) output of a CSO. To\nimprove long-term stability of the new reference, the CSO was locked to the\ntiming signal from the Global Positioning System satellites and corrected for\nthe oscillator aging. The long-term performance of the CSO was measured by\ncomparison against a hydrogen maser in the same laboratory.

However, recent practical and theoretical developments,\nsuch as phased array feeds (PAFs), aperture arrays (AAs) and wide-field\npolarimetry, are exposing limitations of the formalism. This paper aims to\ndevelop a more general formalism that can be used to both clearly define the\nlimitations of the matrix RIME, and to describe observational scenarios that\nlie outside these limitations. Some assumptions underlying the matrix RIME are\nexplicated and analysed in detail. To this purpose, an array correlation matrix\n(ACM) formalism is explored. This proves of limited use; it is shown that\nmatrix algebra is simply not a sufficiently flexible tool for the job. To\novercome these limitations, a more general formalism based on tensors and the\nEinstein notation is proposed and explored both theoretically, and with a view\nto practical implementations. The tensor formalism elegantly yields generalized\nRIMEs describing beamforming, mutual coupling, and wide-field polarimetry in\none equation. It is shown that under the explicated assumptions, tensor\nequations reduce to the 2x2 RIME. From a practical point of view, some methods\nfor implementing tensor equations in an optimal way are proposed and analysed.\nThe tensor RIME is a powerful means of describing observational scenarios not\namenable to the matrix RIME.

Limiting the confusion from Galactic and Extragalactic foregrounds is\ncritical to the success of these telescopes. Instrumental response or the Point\nSpread Function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently 3 dimensional with\nfrequency mapping to the Line of Sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will\nnecessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists;\ntherefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so\nthat the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper\naims to understand the 3 dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the\nsame framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination\nalong frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship\nbetween foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on\nthe Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground\ncontamination-'PSF contamination' and 'gridding contamination'. We show that\n'PSF contamination' is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there\npotentially exists an 'EoR window' with negligible foreground contamination\nwhere we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. 'PSF contamination' in this\nwindow may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window\nfunction. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional 'gridding\ncontamination' and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z\nTransform (CZT) that significantly reduces this contamination. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the analytical relationships and the merit of the new imaging\nalgorithm for the case of imaging with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\n", "authors": "Harish Vedantham, N.

We\ndemonstrate that this compression introduces no bias in the sky background. The\ncompression introduces a small amount of additional digitization noise to the\nimages, and we demonstrate a corresponding small increase in ellipticity\nmeasurement noise. The ellipticity measurement method is biased by the addition\nof noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce a\nmultiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities. After correcting\nfor this known noise-induced bias, we find a residual multiplicative\nellipticity bias of m ~ -4x10^{-4}. This bias is small when compared to the\nmany other issues that precision weak lensing surveys must confront, and\nfurthermore we expect it to be reduced further with better calibration of\nellipticity measurement methods.\n", "authors": "R.

The RFI can then be canceled from the\nastronomy signal paths. However, astronomers typically only require signal\nstatistics. If the RFI statistics are changing slowly, the cancellation can be\napplied to the signal correlations at a much lower rate than is required for\nstandard adaptive filters. In this paper we describe five canceler setups;\nprecorrelation and postcorrelation cancelers that use one or two reference\nsignals in different ways. The theoretical residual RFI and added noise levels\nare examined and are demonstrated using microwave television RFI at the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array. The RFI is attenuated to below the system\nnoise, a reduction of at least 20 dB. While dual-reference cancelers add more\nreference noise than single-reference cancelers, this noise is zero-mean and\nonly adds to the system noise, decreasing the sensitivity. The residual RFI\nthat remains in the output of single-reference cancelers (but not\ndual-reference cancelers) sets a nonzero noise floor that does not act like\nrandom system noise and may limit the achievable sensitivity. Thus,\ndual-reference cancelers often result in superior cancellation. Dual-reference\nprecorrelation cancelers require a double-canceler setup to be useful and to\ngive equivalent results to dual-reference postcorrelation cancelers.\n", "authors": "D. A. Mitchell, J.

Numerical conduction causes erroneous heating of\ngas across the contact discontinuity which has implications for the rate at\nwhich the gas cools. We find that the dynamics of the shocked gas and the\nresulting X-ray emission are strongly dependent on the contrast in the density\nand temperature either side of the contact discontinuity, these effects being\nstrongest where the postshock gas of one flow behaves quasi-adiabatically while\nthe postshock gas of the other flow is strongly radiative.

Basic statistics of the seeing and the isoplanatic angle\nare given, as well as the characteristic time of temporal fluctuations of these\ntwo parameters, which we found to around 30 minutes at 8 m. The 3 DIMMs are\nexploited as a profiler of the surface layer, and provide a robust estimation\nof its statistical properties. It appears to have a very sharp upper limit\n(less than 1 m). The fraction of time spent by each telescope above the top of\nthe surface layer permits us to deduce a median height of between 23 m and 27\nm. The comparison of the different data sets led us to infer the statistical\nproperties of the free atmosphere seeing, with a median value of 0.36 arcsec.\nThe C_n^2 profile inside the surface layer is also deduced from the seeing data\nobtained during the fraction of time spent by the 3 telescopes inside this\nturbulence. Statistically, the surface layer, except during the 3-month summer\nseason, contributes to 95 percent of the total turbulence from the surface\nlevel, thus confirming the exceptional quality of the site above it.\n", "authors": "E.

This conceptual framework is first applied to the history of\nthe 80-cm telescope of Toulouse Observatory, which is initially anchored in a\ngeneral-purpose regime linked to astrometry. After a transition in the 1930s,\nit is integrated in a dedicated regime centered on astrophysics. This evolution\nis compared to that of a very similar instrument, the 80-cm telescope of\nMarseille Observatory, which converts early on to the dedicated regime with the\nFabry-Perot interferometer around 1910, and, after a period of idleness, is\nagain used in the survey mode after WWII.

Mathematical optimization can be used as a computational tool to\nobtain the optimal solution to a given problem in a systematic and efficient\nway. For example, in twice-differentiable functions and problems with no\nconstraints, the optimization consists of finding the points where the gradient\nof the objective function is zero and using the Hessian matrix to classify the\ntype of each point. Sometimes, however it is impossible to compute these\nderivatives and other type of techniques must be employed such as the steepest\ndescent/ascent method and more sophisticated methods such as those based on the\nevolutionary algorithms. Aims. We present a simple algorithm based on the idea\nof genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization. We refer to this algorithm as AGA\n(Asexual Genetic Algorithm) and apply it to two kinds of problems: the\nmaximization of a function where classical methods fail and model fitting in\nastronomy. For the latter case, we minimize the chi-square function to estimate\nthe parameters in two examples: the orbits of exoplanets by taking a set of\nradial velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed\ntowards a YSO (Young Stellar Object). Methods. The algorithm AGA may also be\ncalled genetic, although it differs from standard genetic algorithms in two\nmain aspects: a) the initial population is not encoded, and b) the new\ngenerations are constructed by asexual reproduction. Results. Applying our\nalgorithm in optimizing some complicated functions, we find the global maxima\nwithin a few iterations.

This is possible via new large size matrix\ninversion techniques developed for Gaussian processes (GPs) that do not require\nthat the kernel matrix be sparse. This development, combined with a\nneural-network kernel function appears to give superior results for this\nproblem. Our best fit results for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main\nGalaxy Sample using u,g,r,i,z filters gives an rms error of 0.0201 while our\nresults for the same filters in the luminous red galaxy sample yield 0.0220. We\nalso demonstrate that there appears to be a minimum number of training-set\ngalaxies needed to obtain the optimal fit when using our GPR rank-reduction\nmethods. We find that morphological information included with many photometric\nsurveys appears, for the most part, to make the photometric redshift evaluation\nslightly worse rather than better. This would indicate that most morphological\ninformation simply adds noise from the GP point of view in the data used\nherein.

We studied the achievable precision in the estimate\nof the ionospheric dispersion and the dynamic range of the correlated fringes\nfor different distributions of sub-bands in low-frequency and wide-band\ninterferometric observations. Our study is focused on the case of sub-bands\nwith a bandwidth much narrower than that of the total covered spectrum (case of\nLOFAR). We computed the uncertainty of the ionospheric delay, the delay\nambiguity, and the dynamic range of the fringes using four different kinds of\nsub-band distributions: constant spacing between sub-bands, random spacings,\nspacings based on a power-law distribution, and spacings based on Golomb rulers\n(sets of integers whose sets of differences have non-repeated elements). For a\nlarge number of sub-bands ($> 20$, depending on the delay window) spacings\nbased on Golomb rulers give the most precise estimates of dispersive effects\nand the highest fringe dynamic ranges. Spacings based on the power-law\ndistribution give similar results, although better than those with the Golomb\nrulers for smaller number of sub-bands.

We show this approach conserves energy for\nepicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows to round-off error. In the energy\nequation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of an\neffective potential in a way which guarantees that total energy (including the\ngravitational potential energy) is also conserved to round-off error. We\nintroduce an orbital advection algorithm for MHD based on constrained transport\nto preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. This\nalgorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makes\nthe truncation error more uniform in radial position. Modifications to the\nshearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessary\nto conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. In principle similar corrections\nare also required to conserve mass, momentum and energy, however in practice we\nfind the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than\n0.03% over hundreds of orbits.

This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at\n5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the\nPSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a\nmicroscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an\nover-resolved MIRIM PSF.

The concentration power of an optical\nmodule, which determines primarily the telescope's sensitivity, is in general\nexpressed by its on-axis effective area as a function of the X-ray energy.\nNevertheless, the effective area of X-ray mirrors in general decreases as the\nsource moves off-axis, with a consequent loss of sensitivity. To make matters\nworse, the dense nesting of mirror shells in an optical module results in a\nmutual obstruction of their aperture when an astronomical source is off-axis,\nwith a further effective area reduction. [...] While the effective area of an\nX-ray mirror is easy to predict on-axis, the same task becomes more difficult\nfor a source off-axis. It is therefore important to develop an appropriate\nformalism to reliably compute the off-axis effective area of a Wolter-I mirror,\nincluding the effect of obstructions. Most of collecting area simulation for\nX-ray optical modules has been so far performed along with numerical codes,\ninvolving ray-tracing routines, very effective but in general complex,\ndifficult to handle, time consuming and affected by statistical errors. In\ncontrast, in a previous paper we approached this problem from an analytical\nviewpoint, to the end of simplifying and speeding up the prediction of the\noff-axis effective area of unobstructed X-ray mirrors with any reflective\ncoating, including multilayers.In this work we extend the analytical results\nobtained: we show that the analytical formula for the off-axis effective area\ncan be inverted, and we expose in detail a novel analytical treatment of mutual\nshell obstruction in densely nested mirror assemblies, which reduces the\noff-axis effective area computation to a simple integration. The results are in\nexcellent agreement with the findings of a detailed ray-tracing routine.\n", "authors": "Daniele Spiga"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2011-01-05T05:47:19Z", "title": "DiFX2: A more flexible, efficient, robust and powerful software\n  correlator", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0885v1", "summary": "  Software correlation, where a correlation algorithm written in a high-level\nlanguage such as C++ is run on commodity computer hardware, has become\nincreasingly attractive for small to medium sized and/or bandwidth constrained\nradio interferometers.

We investigated three distinctly different situations for\nperforming pipelined data reduction in SOFIA: automated data reduction after\ndata archival at the end of a mission, re-pipelining of science data with\nupdated calibrations or optimum parameters, and the interactive user-driven\nlocal execution and analysis of data reduction by an investigator. These\ndifferent modes would traditionally result in very different software\nimplementations of algorithms used by each instrument team, in effect tripling\nthe amount of data reduction software that would need to be maintained by\nSOFIA.

The SOFIA data reduction structure would host the\ndifferent algorithms and techniques that the instrument teams develop in their\nown environment. Ideally, duplication of software is minimized across the\nsystem because instrument teams can draw on software solutions and techniques\npreviously delivered to SOFIA by other instruments.

The calibration coefficient C derived from numerical\nsimulations of polychromatic scintillation shows dependence on the height of\nthe turbulence layer, wind speed, and seeing. The previously recommended value\nof C=1.27 is a good match to typical conditions, while C can vary from 0.6 to\n1.6 in other circumstances. For two nights, MASS was compared with the time\nconstant measured with adaptive optics, and the expected agreement was found.\nWe show that the single-layer approximation used in some AO systems to derive\nthe AO time constant can give wrong results. A better approach is to estimate\nit from the speed of focus variation (the FADE method).

Given the large amount of data\nthat we are getting (more than 150 nights of observations at three different\nobservatories in the last 4 years) we have developed an automatic spectroscopic\nreduction pipeline. This pipeline has been programmed in IDL and automates the\nprocess of data reduction. It can operate in two modes: automatic data\nreduction (quicklook) or semi-automatic data reduction (full). In \"quicklook\",\nwe are able to get rectified and calibrated spectra of all stars of a full\nnight just minutes after the observations. The pipeline automatically\nidentifies the type of image and applies the standard reduction procedure (bias\nsubtraction, flat field correction, application of bad pixel mask, ...). It\nalso extracts all spectra of the stars in one image (including close visual\nbinaries), aligns and merges all spectra of the same star (to increase the\nsignal to noise ratio and to correct defects such as cosmic rays), calibrates\nin wavelength and rectifies the continuum.

An important case in which this approximation breaks down is during\nfrequency synthesis if the observing bandwidth is wide enough for variations in\nthe spectrum of the sky to become significant. The convolution assumption also\nbreaks down, in any situation but snapshot observations, if sources in the\nfield vary significantly in flux density over the duration of the observation.\nSuch time-variation can even be instrumental in nature, for example due to\njitter or rotation of the primary beam pattern on the sky during an\nobservation. An algorithm already exists for dealing with the spectral\nvariation encountered in wide-band frequency synthesis interferometry. This\nalgorithm is an extension of CLEAN in which, at each iteration, a set of N\n`dirty beams' are fitted and subtracted in parallel, instead of just a single\ndirty beam as in standard CLEAN. In the wide-band algorithm the beams are\nobtained by expanding a nominal source spectrum in a Taylor series, each term\nof the series generating one of the beams. In the present paper this algorithm\nis extended to images which contain sources which vary over both frequency and\ntime. Different expansion schemes (or bases) on the time and frequency axes are\ncompared, and issues such as Gibbs ringing and non-orthogonality are discussed.\nIt is shown that practical considerations make it often desirable to\northogonalize the set of beams before commencing the cleaning.

To implement\nsuch stored functions for fast radial search and cross-identification with\nminimum cost, we applied a simple technique that is not based on dividing\ncelestial sphere such as HTM or HEALPix. In contrast, the Web application layer\nbecame compact, and was written in simple procedural PHP codes. In total, our\nsystem realizes cost-effective maintenance and enhancements.\n", "authors": "C.

Sumner, New Mexico on\nOctober 9, 2009. ProtoEXIST1 is the first implementation of an advanced CdZnTe\n(CZT) imaging detector in our ongoing program to establish the technology\nrequired for next generation wide-field hard X-ray telescopes. The CZT detector\nplane in ProtoEXIST1 consists of an 8 x 8 array of closely tiled 2 cm x 2 cm x\n0.5 cm thick pixellated CZT crystals, each with 8 x 8 pixels, covering a 256\ncm^2 active area with 2.5 mm pixels. A tungsten mask, mounted at 90 cm above\nthe detector provides shadowgrams of X-ray sources in the 30 - 600 keV band for\nimaging, allowing a fully coded field of view of 9 Deg x 9 Deg with an angular\nresolution of 20 arcmin. To reduce the background radiation, the detector is\nsurrounded by semi-graded (Pb/Sn/Cu) passive shields on the four sides all the\nway to the mask. On the back side, a 26 cm x 26 cm x 2 cm CsI(Na) active shield\nprovides signals to tag charged particle induced events as well as >~ 100 keV\nbackground photons from below. The flight duration was only about 7.5 hours due\nto strong winds (60 knots) at float altitude (38-39 km). Throughout the flight,\nthe CZT detector performed excellently. The telescope observed Cyg X-1 for ~ 1\nhour at the end of the flight. Despite a few problems with the pointing and\naspect systems that caused the telescope to track about 6.4 deg off the target,\nthe analysis of the Cyg X-1 data revealed an X-ray source at 7.2 sigma in the\n30-100 keV energy band at the expected location from the optical images taken\nby the onboard daytime star camera. The success of this first flight is very\nencouraging for the future development of the advanced CZT imaging detectors\n(ProtoEXIST2, with 0.6 mm pixels).\n", "authors": "J. Hong, B. Allen, J.

Using data from the\nCosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS), we demonstrate two key astronomical\napplications of the SOM: (i) object classification and selection, using the\nexample of galaxies with active galactic nuclei as a demonstration, and (ii)\nphotometric redshift estimation, illustrating how SOMs can be used as totally\nempirical predictive tools. With a training set of ~3800 galaxies with\nz_spec<1, we achieve photometric redshift accuracies competitive with other\n(mainly template fitting) techniques that use a similar number of photometric\nbands (sigma(Dz)=0.03 with a ~2% outlier rate when using u*-band to 8um\nphotometry).

Each packet may contain zero\nor more of the \"who, what, where, when & how\" of a detected event, but in\naddition, may contain a hypothesis (a \"why\") regarding the nature of the\nunderlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be\nused to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged\nthroughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive\nfollow-ups. VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically\nstored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore\nreference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and\nto be processed quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the\ndesign of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not cover\npolicy issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry of events, who\ncan subscribe to a particular registry, nor the intellectual property issues.\n", "authors": "Rob Seaman, Roy Williams, Alasdair Allan, Scott Barthelmy, Joshua Bloom, John Brewer, Robert Denny, Mike Fitzpatrick, Matthew Graham, Norman Gray, Frederic Hessman, Szabolcs Marka, Arnold Rots, Tom Vestrand, Przemyslaw Wozniak"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2011-10-03T21:49:37Z", "title": "IVOA Recommendation: VOTable Format Definition Version 1.2", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0524v1", "summary": "  This document describes the structures making up the version 1.2 of the\nVOTable standard, which supersedes the version 1.1 of 08 August 2004.

These requirements set a stringent constraint on the accuracy of the\nestimation of the location of the stellar image on the CCD for each\nobservation: e.g., 0.3 milli-arseconds (mas) or 0.005 pixels for the same V=15\nG2V star. However the Gaia CCDs will suffer from charge transfer inefficiency\n(CTI) caused by radiation damage that will degrade the stellar image quality\nand may degrade the astrometric performance of Gaia if not properly addressed.\nFor the first time at this level of detail, the potential impact of radiation\ndamage on the performance of Gaia is investigated. In this first paper we focus\non the evaluation of the CTI impact on the image location accuracy. We show\nthat CTI decreases the stellar image signal-to-noise ratio and irreversibly\ndegrades the image location estimation precision. As a consequence the location\nestimation standard errors increase by up to 6% for a radiation damage level\nequivalent to the end-of-mission. In addition the CTI-induced image distortion\nintroduces a systematic bias in the image location estimation (up to 0.05\npixels or 3 mas in the Gaia operating conditions). We present a novel approach\nto CTI mitigation that enables, without correction of the raw data, the\nunbiased estimation of the image location and flux from damaged observations.\nIts implementation reduces the maximum measured location bias for the faintest\nmagnitude to 0.005 pixels (~4e-4 pixels at magnitude 15).

SPICA will realize a 3m class telescope cooled to\n6K in orbit. The launch of SPICA is planned to take place in FY2018. The SPICA\nmission provides us with a unique opportunity to make high dynamic-range\nobservations because of its large telescope aperture, high stability, and the\ncapability for making infrared observations from deep space. The SCI is a high\ndynamic-range instrument proposed for SPICA. The primary objectives for the SCI\nare the direct coronagraphic detection and spectroscopy of Jovian exoplanets in\nthe infrared region, while the monitoring of transiting planets is another\nimportant target owing to the non-coronagraphic mode of the SCI. Then, recent\ntechnical progress and ideas in conceptual studies are presented, which can\npotentially enhance the performance of the instrument: the designs of an\nintegral 1-dimensional binary-shaped pupil mask coronagraph with general\ndarkness constraints, a concentric ring mask considering the obscured pupil for\nsurveying a wide field, and a spectral disperser for simultaneous wide\nwavelength coverage, and the first results of tests of the toughness of MEMS\ndeformable mirrors for the rocket launch are introduced, together with a\ndescription of a passive wavefront correction mirror using no actuator.\n", "authors": "K.

The PSF and\npixel response describe the spatial blurring of the source, the pixel scale\ndescribes the spatial sampling of a single exposure, and the observing strategy\ndetermines the set of dithered exposures with pointing offsets from which the\nsource flux is inferred. In a wide-field imaging survey, sources of interest\nare randomly distributed within the field of view and hence are centered\nrandomly within a pixel. A given hardware configuration and observing strategy\ntherefore have a distribution of photometric uncertainty for sources of fixed\nflux that fall in the field. In this article we explore the ensemble behavior\nof photometric and position accuracies for different PSFs, pixel scales, and\ndithering patterns. We find that the average uncertainty in the flux\ndetermination depends slightly on dither strategy, whereas the position\ndetermination can be strongly dependent on the dithering. For cases with pixels\nmuch larger than the PSF, the uncertainty distributions can be non-Gaussian,\nwith rms values that are particularly sensitive to the dither strategy. We also\nfind that for these configurations with large pixels, pointings dithered by a\nfractional pixel amount do not always give minimal average uncertainties; this\nis in contrast to image reconstruction for which fractional dithers are\noptimal. When fractional pixel dithering is favored, a pointing accuracy of\nbetter than $\\sim 0.15$ pixel width is required to maintain half the advantage\nover random dithers.\n", "authors": "Johan Samsing, Alex G.

Such methods use a linear decomposition of\nthe kernel on a series of basis functions. The correct choice of these basis\nfunctions is fundamental to the efficiency and effectiveness of the matching -\nthe chosen bases should represent the underlying signal using a reasonably\nsmall number of shapes, and/or have a minimum number of user-adjustable tuning\nparameters. We examine methods whose bases comprise multiple Gauss-Hermite\npolynomials, as well as a form free basis composed of delta-functions. Kernels\nderived from delta-functions are unsurprisingly shown to be more expressive;\nthey are able to take more general shapes and perform better in situations\nwhere sum-of-Gaussian methods are known to fail. However, due to its many\ndegrees of freedom (the maximum number allowed by the kernel size) this basis\ntends to overfit the problem, and yields noisy kernels having large variance.\nWe introduce a new technique to regularize these delta-function kernel\nsolutions, which bridges the gap between the generality of delta-function\nkernels, and the compactness of sum-of-Gaussian kernels. Through this\nregularization we are able to create general kernel solutions that represent\nthe intrinsic shape of the PSF-matching kernel with only one degree of freedom,\nthe strength of the regularization lambda. The role of lambda is effectively to\nexchange variance in the resulting difference image with variance in the kernel\nitself. We examine considerations in choosing the value of lambda, including\nstatistical risk estimators and the ability of the solution to predict\nsolutions for adjacent areas.

This improvement\nin resolution can potentially improve the photometry of faint stars in\nextremely crowded fields significantly by alleviating crowding. Alleviating\ncrowding is a prerequisite for observing gravitational microlensing in main\nsequence stars towards the galactic bulge. However, the photometric stability\nof this device has not been assessed. The EMCCD has sources of noise not found\nin conventional CCDs, and new methods for handling these must be developed.\n  We aim to investigate how the normal photometric reduction steps from\nconventional CCDs should be adjusted to be applicable to EMCCD data. One\ncomplication is that a bias frame cannot be obtained conventionally, as the\noutput from an EMCCD is not normally distributed. Also, the readout process\ngenerates spurious charges in any CCD, but in EMCCD data, these charges are\nvisible as opposed to the conventional CCD. Furthermore we aim to eliminate the\nphoton waste associated with lucky imaging by combining this method with\nshift-and-add.\n  A simple probabilistic model for the dark output of an EMCCD is developed.\nFitting this model with the expectation-maximization algorithm allows us to\nestimate the bias, readout noise, amplification, and spurious charge rate per\npixel and thus correct for these phenomena.

This system utilizes a combination\nof an all-solid-state mode-locked sum-frequency generation (SFG) laser (1.7-GHz\nbandwidth, 0.7-ns pulse width) as a light source and a single-mode optical\nfiber for beam transference. However, optical fibers induce nonlinear effects,\nespecially self-phase modulation (SPM). We studied SPM in our photonic crystal\nfiber (PCF). SPM broadens the spectrum of a laser beam and decrease the\nefficiency of bright laser guide star generation. We measured the spectrum\nwidth using a spectrum analyzer. We found a spectrum width of 8.4 GHz at full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM). The original FWHM of our laser spectrum was 1.4\nGHz. This was equivalent to a 70 % loss in laser energy. We also measured the\nbrightness of the sodium cell and evaluated its performance as a function of\nlaser wavelength. The cell's brightness showed a peculiar tendency;\nspecifically, it did not extinguish even though the wavelength varied by more\nthan 5 pm. To reduce the impact of SPM, we developed an optical system that\ndivides one laser pulse into four lower-power pulses. The laser peak power\nafter passing through the new optical system was decreased to one-fourth the\noriginal, reducing the impact of SPM on the sodium cell. An actual laser guide\nstar created with the new system was 0.41 mag brighter than the laser guide\nstar created with the original system. We achieved brighter laser guide star\ngeneration by dividing a laser pulse to reduce its peak intensity.

The integers are then losslessly compressed\nusing the fast and efficient Rice algorithm and stored in a portable FITS\nformat file. Quantizing an image more coarsely gives greater image compression,\nbut it also increases the noise and degrades the precision of the photometric\nand astrometric measurements in the quantized image. Dithering the pixel values\nduring the quantization process can greatly improve the precision of\nmeasurements in the images.

Compared to\n1988, the 2009/10 data show no change in the sky brightness at Zenith though,\nas expected, the sky glow has increased most dramatically in the direction of\nTucson. Comparisons between the 1999 and 2009/10 data suggest that the sky has\nactually decreased in brightness compared to 10 years ago. However, the older\ndata were both taken during times of increased solar activity. When we correct\nthe measurements for the solar irradiance fluctuations, we find that compared\nto 20 years ago, the sky is ~0.1 magnitude brighter at Zenith and ~0.3\nmagnitudes brighter towards Tucson. But even after these corrections, we still\nfind that the sky over Kitt Peak is comparable to what it was 10 years ago at\nZenith and ~0.1 magnitude darker towards Tucson.

In astronomy, the increasing scale of current and future\nsurveys is driving a trend towards a separation of the processes of low-level\ndata reduction and higher-level scientific analysis. Algorithms and software\nresponsible for the former are becoming increasingly complex, and at the same\ntime more general - measurements will be used for a wide variety of scientific\nstudies, and many of these cannot be anticipated in advance. On the other hand,\nincreased sample sizes and the corresponding decrease in stochastic uncertainty\nputs greater importance on controlling systematic errors, which must happen for\nthe most part at the lowest levels of data analysis. Astronomical measurement\nalgorithms must improve in their handling of uncertainties as well, and hence\nmust be designed with detailed knowledge of the requirements of different\nscience goals.

We present a Monte Carlo algorithm that can\nefficiently sample from the posterior probability for a flexible class of\ngalaxy models, and propose a method for constructing and convolving these\nmodels using Gauss-Hermite (\"shapelet\") functions.

In the astronomical\ndomain, DM/KDD are still in a very early usage stage, even though new methods\nand tools are being continuously deployed in order to cope with the Massive\nData Sets (MDS) that can only grow in the future. In this paper, we briefly\noutline some general problems encountered when applying DM/KDD methods to\nastrophysical problems, and describe the DAME (DAta Mining & Exploration) web\napplication. While specifically tailored to work on MDS, DAME can be\neffectively applied also to smaller data sets. As an illustration, we describe\ntwo application of DAME to two different problems: the identification of\ncandidate globular clusters in external galaxies, and the classification of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). We believe that tools and services of this nature\nwill become increasingly necessary for the data-intensive astronomy (and indeed\nall sciences) in the 21st century.\n", "authors": "Massimo Brescia, Stefano Cavuoti, S.

Although Concordia station at Dome C\n(Antarctica) enjoys good observing conditions in this atmospheric spectral\nwindows, as shown by preliminary site-testing campaigns at different bands and\nin, not always, time overlapped periods, a dedicated instrument able to\ncontinuously determine atmospheric performance for a wide spectral range is not\nyet planned. In the absence of such measurements, in this paper we suggest a\nsemi-empirical approach to perform an analysis of atmospheric transmission and\nemission at Dome C to compare the performance for 7 photometric bands ranging\nfrom 100 GHz to 2 THz. Radiosoundings data provided by the Routine\nMeteorological Observations (RMO) Research Project at Concordia station are\ncorrected by temperature and humidity errors and dry biases and then employed\nto feed ATM (Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves) code to generate synthetic\nspectra in the wide spectral range from 100 GHz to 2 THz. To quantify the\natmospheric contribution in millimeter and sub-millimeter observations we are\nconsidering several photometric bands in which atmospheric quantities are\nintegrated. The observational capabilities of this site at all the selected\nspectral bands are analyzed considering monthly averaged transmissions joined\nto the corresponding fluctuations. Transmission and pwv statistics at Dome C\nderived by our semi-empirical approach are consistent with previous works. It\nis evident the decreasing of the performance at high frequencies. We propose to\nintroduce a new parameter to compare the quality of a site at different\nspectral bands, in terms of high transmission and emission stability, the Site\nPhotometric Quality Factor.\n", "authors": "S.

Wavelets allow us to reformulate the RM synthesis method in a\nscale-dependent way and to visualize the data as a function of Faraday depth\nand scale. We present observational tests to recognize magnetic field\nstructures. A region with a regular magnetic field generates a broad \"disk\" in\nFaraday space (\"Faraday spectrum\"), with two \"horns\" when the distribution of\ncosmic-ray electrons is broader than that of the thermal electrons. Each\nmagnetic field reversal generates one asymmetric \"horn\" on top of the \"disk\". A\nregion with a turbulent field can be recognized as a \"Faraday forest\" of many\ncomponents. These tests are applied to the spectral ranges of various synthesis\nradio telescopes. We argue that the ratio of maximum to minimum wavelengths\ndetermines the range of scales that can be identified in Faraday space. A\nreliable recognition of magnetic field structures requires the analysis of data\ncubes in position-position-Faraday depth space (\"PPF cubes\"), observed over a\nwide and continuous wavelength range, allowing the recognition of a wide range\nof scales as well as high resolution in Faraday space.

Their\nperformance can be restored by using an additional optimally designed apodizer\nthat changes the amplitude in the first pupil plane so that the on-axis light\nis rejected outside the obstructed aperture of the telescope. The numerical\noptimization model is built by maximizing the apodizer's transmission while\nsetting constraints on the extremum values of the electric field that the Lyot\nstop does not block. The coronagraphic image is compared to what a non-apodized\nphase mask coronagraph provides and an analysis is made of the trade-offs that\nexist between the apodizer transmission and the Lyot stop properties. The\nexistence of a solution and the mask transmission depend on the aperture and\nthe Lyot stop geometries, and on the constraints that are set on the on-axis\nattenuation.

These\naberrations create long-lived speckles in the scientific image plane, which can\neasily be mistaken for planets. Common adaptive optics systems require\ndedicated components to perform wave-front analysis. The ultimate wave-front\nmeasurement performance is thus limited by the unavoidable differential\naberrations between the wavefront sensor and the scientific camera. To reach\nthe level of detectivity required by high-contrast imaging, these differential\naberrations must be estimated and compensated for. In this paper, we\ncharacterize and experimentally validate a wave-front sensing method that\nrelies on focal-plane data. Our method, called COFFEE (for COronagraphic\nFocal-plane wave-Front Estimation for Exoplanet detection), is based on a\nBayesian approach, and it consists in an extension of phase diversity to\nhigh-contrast imaging. It estimates the differential aberrations using only two\nfocal-plane coronagraphic images recorded from the scientific camera itself. In\nthis paper, we first present a thorough characterization of COFFEE's\nperformance by means of numerical simulations. This characterization is then\ncompared with an experimental validation of COFFEE using an in-house adaptive\noptics bench and an apodized Roddier & Roddier phase mask coronagraph. An\nexcellent match between experimental results and the theoretical study is\nfound. Lastly, we present a preliminary validation of COFFEE's ability to\ncompensate for the aberrations upstream of a coronagraph.\n", "authors": "B. Paul, L. M. Mugnier, J. -F.

Application to\n  the SODISM solar telescope on board the PICARD space mission", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1437v1", "summary": "  When Charge Coupled Devices are used for scientific observations, their dark\nsignal is a hindrance. In their pristine state, most CCD pixels are `cool';\nthey exhibit low, quasi uniform dark current, which can be estimated and\ncorrected for. In space, after having been hit by an energetic particle, pixels\ncan turn `hot'. They start delivering excessive, less predictable, dark\ncurrent. The hot pixels need therefore to be flagged so that subsequent\nanalysis may ignore them. The image data of the PICARD SODISM solar telescope\n(Meftah et al. 2013) require dark signal correction and hot pixel\nidentification. Its frame transfer E2V 42-80 CCD operates at -7{\\deg}C. Both\nimage and memory zones thus accumulate dark current during, respectively,\nintegration and readout time. These two components must be separated to\nestimate the dark signal for any observation. This is the purpose of the Dark\nSignal Model presented in this paper. The dark signal time series of every\npixel is processed by the Unbalanced Haar Technique (Fryzlewicz 2007) in order\nto timestamp when its dark signal is expected to change. In-between those\ninstants, both components are assumed constant and a robust linear regression\nvs. integration time provides first estimates and a quality coefficient. The\nlatter serves to assign definitive estimates. Our model is part of the SODISM\nLevel 1 data production scheme. To check its reliability, we verify on dark\nframes that it leaves a negligible residual bias (5 e-), and generates a small\nRMS error (25 e- rms). The cool pixel level is found to be 4 e-/pxl/s, in\nagreement with the predicted value. The emergence rate of hot pixels is\ninvestigated too. It legitimates a threshold criterion at 50 e-/pxl/s. The\ngrowth rate is found to be 4% of the frame area per year.

The spectral response of\nthe HFI is used in Planck data analysis and component separation, this includes\nextraction of CO emission observed within Planck bands, dust emission,\nSunyaev-Zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. The HFI\nspectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion and\ncolour correction analysis tools.

This\nvalidation includes use of HFI zodiacal emission observations to demonstrate\nout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. The accuracy of the HFI\nrelative spectral response data is verified through comparison with\ncomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colour\ncorrection coefficients.

Combined with low order adaptive optics it can deliver\nresolution several times better than that of the Hubble Space Telescope. Many\nimages are taken at high speed as atmospheric turbulent effects appear static\non these short timescales. The sharpest images are selected, shifted and added\nto give a much higher resolution than is normally possible in ground-based long\nexposure time observations. The method is relatively inefficient as a\nsignificant fraction of the frames are discarded because of their relatively\npoor quality. This paper shows that a new Lucky Imaging processing method\ninvolving selection in Fourier space can substantially improve the selection\npercentages. The results show that high resolution images with a large\nisoplanatic patch size may be obtained routinely both with conventional Lucky\nImaging and with the new Lucky Fourier method.

With the development of modern\ntechnologies it is possible to obtain datacubes in which one combines both\ntechniques simultaneously, producing images with spectral resolution. To\nextract information from them can be quite complex, and hence the development\nof new methods of data analysis is desirable. We present a method of analysis\nof datacube (data from single field observations, containing two spatial and\none spectral dimension) that uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to express\nthe data in the form of reduced dimensionality, facilitating efficient\ninformation extraction from very large data sets. PCA transforms the system of\ncorrelated coordinates into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by\nprincipal components of decreasing variance. The new coordinates are referred\nto as eigenvectors, and the projections of the data onto these coordinates\nproduce images we will call tomograms. The association of the tomograms\n(images) to eigenvectors (spectra) is important for the interpretation of both.\nThe eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal and this information is fundamental\nfor their handling and interpretation. When the datacube shows objects that\npresent uncorrelated physical phenomena, the eigenvector's orthogonality may be\ninstrumental in separating and identifying them. By handling eigenvectors and\ntomograms one can enhance features, extract noise, compress data, extract\nspectra, etc. We applied the method, for illustration purpose only, to the\ncentral region of the LINER galaxy NGC 4736, and demonstrate that it has a type\n1 active nucleus, not known before.

A bolometric interferometer will have to take\nadvantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers in order to be\ncompetitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers\nare presumed to be importantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth\nsmearing. In this paper, we investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work\nprinciple of a bolometric interferometer and how it affects its sensitivity to\nthe CMB angular power spectra. We obtain analytical expressions for the\nbroadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric\ninterferometers.

Therefore, the full\nexploitation of the C-COSMOS data requires a dedicated and accurate analysis\nfocused on three main issues: 1) maximizing the sensitivity when the PSF\nchanges strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1\narcsec up to ~10 arcsec half power radius); 2) resolving close pairs; and 3)\nobtaining the best source localization and count rate. We present here our\ntreatment of four key analysis items: source detection, localization,\nphotometry, and survey sensitivity. Our final procedure consists of a two step\nprocedure: (1) a wavelet detection algorithm, to find source candidates, (2) a\nmaximum likelihood Point Spread Function fitting algorithm to evaluate the\nsource count rates and the probability that each source candidate is a\nfluctuation of the background.

In that respect, both ESA and NASA have identified\nnulling interferometry as one of the most promising techniques. The ability to\nstudy distant planets will however depend on exozodiacal dust clouds\nsurrounding the target stars. In this paper, we assess the impact of\nexozodiacal dust clouds on the performance of an infrared nulling\ninterferometer in the Emma X-array configuration.

Program packages have been developed for a spatially variable PSF, but\nthey require that a sufficient number of bright, isolated stars in the image\nare present to adequately sample the PSF. Imaging the Galactic center is\nparticularly challenging. We present two ways of dealing with spatially\nvariable PSFs when only one or very few suitable PSF reference stars are\npresent in the field. Local PSF fitting with the StarFinder algorithm is\napplied to the data. Satisfying results can be found in two ways: (a) creating\nlocal PSFs by merging locally extracted PSF cores with the PSF wings estimated\nfrom the brightest star in the field; (b) Wiener deconvolution of the image\nwith the PSF estimated from the brightest star in the field and subsequent\nestimation of local PSFs on the deconvolved image. The methodology is tested on\nreal, and on artificial images. The method involving Wiener deconvolution of\nthe image prior to local PSF extraction and fitting gives excellent results. It\nlimits systematic effects to ~2-5% in point source photometry and ~10% in\ndiffuse emission on fields-of-view as large as 28\" x 28\" and observed through\nthe H-band filter. Particular attention is given to how deconvolution changes\nthe noise properties of the image. It is shown that mean positions and fluxes\nof the stars are conserved by the deconvolution. However, the estimated\nuncertainties of the PSF fitting algorithm are too small if the presence of\ncovariances is ignored in the PSF fitting as has been done here.

The current design of FKSI is a\ntwo-element nulling interferometer. The two telescopes, separated by 12.5 m,\nare precisely pointed (by small steering mirrors) on the target star. The two\npath lengths are accurately controlled to be the same to within a few\nnanometers.

When properly oriented, the starlight is\nnulled by a factor of 10^-4, and the planet light is undiminished. Accurate\nmodeling of the signal is used to subtract the residual starlight, permitting\nthe detection of planets much fainter than the host star.

These improvements will also enable large surveys of white dwarf\nstars, e.g. GAIA, to advance stellar astrophysics by testing and providing\nconstraints for the mass-radius relationship of these stars.\n  ACCESS (Absolute Color Calibration Experiment for Standard Stars) is a\nrocket-borne payload that will enable the transfer of absolute laboratory\ndetector standards from NIST to a network of stellar standards with a\ncalibration accuracy of 1% and a spectral resolving power of R = 500 across the\n0.35-1.7 micron bandpass.\n  Among the strategies being employed to minimize calibration uncertainties\nare: (1) judicious selection of standard stars (previous calibration heritage,\nminimal spectral features, robust stellar atmosphere models), (2) execution of\nobservations above the Earth's atmosphere (eliminates atmospheric contamination\nof the stellar spectrum), (3) a single optical path and detector (to minimize\nvisible to NIR cross-calibration uncertainties), (4) establishment of an a\npriori error budget, (5) on-board monitoring of instrument performance, and (6)\nfitting stellar atmosphere models to the data to search for discrepancies and\nconfirm performance.\n", "authors": "Mary Elizabeth Kaiser, Jeffrey W.

The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey\n(2MASS) data are extensively used to probe for coordinate and coma-like\nsystematic errors in UCAC data mainly caused by the poor charge transfer\nefficiency (CTE) of the 4K CCD. Errors up to about 200 mas have been corrected\nusing complex look-up tables handling multiple dependencies derived from the\nresiduals. Similarly, field distortions and sub-pixel phase errors have also\nbeen evaluated using the residuals with respect to 2MASS. The overall magnitude\nequation is derived from UCAC calibration field observations alone, independent\nof external catalogs.

The model predicts many\ntrends which are seen experimentally, for example, a decrease in FRD as core\ndiameter increases, and also as wavelength increases. However the model also\npredicts a strong dependence on FRD with length that is not seen\nexperimentally.

At radio wavelengths, astronomical spectra are highly\npopulated with RRLs, which serve as ideal probes of the physical conditions in\nmolecular cloud complexes. An analysis of the Hn(alpha) lines presented herein\nshows that RRLs of higher principal quantum number (n>90) are generally\ndivergent from their expected Gaussian profiles and, moreover, are well\ndescribed by their respective Voigt profiles. This is in agreement with the\ntheory that spectral lines experience pressure broadening as a result of\nelectron collisions at lower radio frequencies. Given the inherent technical\ndifficulties regarding the detection and profiling of true RRL wing spans and\nshapes, it is crucial that the observing instrumentation produce flat baselines\nas well as high sensitivity, high resolution data. The GBT has demonstrated its\ncapabilities regarding all of these aspects, and we believe that future\nobservations of RRL emission via the GBT will be crucial towards advancing our\nknowledge of the larger-scale extended structures of ionized gas in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM).\n", "authors": "Azrael A. von Prochazka, Anthony J.

This approach is based on the notion-strictly hypothetical-that if a\nparticular star could be observed continuously, the instrument would in time\nobserve all portions of the habitable zone so that no planet residing therein\ncould be missed. This strategy could not be implemented in any realistic\nmission scenario. But if an exoplanet's orbit is known from astrometric\nobservation, then it may be possible to plan and schedule a sequence of imaging\nobservations that is the equivalent of continuous observation. A series of\nimages-optimally spaced in time-could be recorded to examine contiguous\nsegments of the orbit. In time, all segments would be examined, leading to the\ninevitable detection of the planet. In this paper, we show how astrometric\norbit information can be used to construct such a sequence. Using stars from\nastrometric and imaging target lists, we find that the number of observations\nin this sequence typically ranges from 2 to 7, representing the maximum number\nof observations required to find the planet. The probable number of\nobservations ranges from 1.5 to 3.1. This is a dramatic improvement in\nefficiency over previous methods proposed for utilizing astrometric orbits.

Here, a new method for creating\nband-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a\ndrizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward\na band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting\nprovided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative\nDrizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and\nconvolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The\nmethod works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily\nhandle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images\ntaken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a\ngood final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements.\niDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread\nfunctions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for\nfuture Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely\nattempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with\nundersampled detectors.\n", "authors": "Andrew S.

This high efficiency may be reached by coating a backside\nilluminated, thinned, delta-doped CCD with a series of thin film\nanti-reflection coatings. The materials tested include MgF2 (optimized for\nhighest performance from 120-150nm), SiO2 (150-180nm), Al2O3(180-240nm), MgO\n(200-250nm), and HfO2 (240-300nm). A variety of deposition techniques were\ntested and a selection of coatings which minimized reflectance on a Si test\nwafer were applied to live devices. We also discuss future uses and\nimprovements, including graded and multi-layer coatings.\n", "authors": "Erika T. Hamden, Frank Greer, Michael E. Hoenk, Jordana Blacksberg, Matthew R.

Previously cited laboratory experiments\nin supporting this hypothesis were performed either in a different type of flow\nthan Keplerian or without quantitative measurements of angular momentum\ntransport and mean flow profile, and all of them appear to suffer from Ekman\neffects, secondary flows induced by nonoptimal axial boundary conditions.

The standard stars BD+59d389 (polarized) and HD14069 (unpolarized)\nwere observed with CAFOS in November, 2010, using 16 half-wave plate angles.\nThe linear spectropolarimetric properties of CAFOS were studied using a Fourier\nAnalysis of the resulting data.\n  Results. CAFOS shows a roughly constant instrumental polarization at the\nlevel of ~0.3% between 4000 and 8600 A. Below 4000 A the spurious polarization\ngrows to reach ~0.7% at 3600 A. This instrumental effect is most likely\nproduced by the telescope optics, and appears to be additive. The Wollaston\nprism presents a clear deviation from the ideal behavior. The problem is\nlargely removed by the usage of at least 4 retarder plate angles. The\nchromatism of the half-wave plate causes a peak-to-peak oscillation of ~11\ndegrees in the polarization angle.

The tool provides transparent access to\nASDC-resident catalogs (e.g. Swift, AGILE, Fermi etc.) as well as to external\narchives (e.g. NED, 2MASS, SDSS etc.) covering the whole electromagnetic\nspectrum, from radio to TeV energies. Proprietary data can also be properly\nhandled. The intent of this document is to provide a brief description of the\nmain capabilities of the ASDC SED Builder.

The method, that we named\ndraining algorithm, ensures that the maximum number of targets in a given\ntarget field is observed in the first few tiles. Using randomly distributed\ntargets and mock galaxy catalogs we have estimated that the gain provided by\nthe draining algorithm as compared to a random assignment can be as much as 2%\nfor the first tiles. This would imply for a survey like BigBOSS saving for\nobservation several hundred thousand objects or, alternatively, reducing the\ncovered area in ~350 sq. deg. An important advantage of this method is that the\nfiber collision problem can be solved easily and in an optimal way. We also\ndiscuss additional optimizations of the fiber positioning process. In\nparticular, we show that allowing for rotation of the focal plane can improve\nthe efficiency of the process in ~3.5-4.5% even if only small adjustments are\npermitted (up to 2 deg). For instruments that allow large rotations of the\nfocal plane the expected gain increases to ~5-6%.

Simultaneously, a number of groups experimented with passive\ndetection of radio emission from EAS as a possible cheap, simple, stand-alone\nmethod to detect and characterise showers of energy greater than 10^16 eV. By\nthe end of the decade, it was shown that the radio emission was quite highly\nbeamed and hence the effective collection area for detection of high energy\nshowers was quite limited, diminishing the effectiveness of the radio signature\nas a stand-alone shower detection channel. By the early 1970s much of the early\noptimism for both the optical and radio techniques was beginning to dissipate,\ngreatly reducing research activity. However, following a long hiatus both\navenues were in time revived, the optical in the early 1980s and the radio in\nthe early 2000s. With the advent of digital logic hardware, powerful low-cost\ncomputing, the ability to perform Monte Carlo simulations and above all,\ngreatly improved funding, rapid progress became possible. In time this work\nproved to be fundamental to both High Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy and Neutrino\nAstrophysics. Here, that first decade of experimental investigation in both\nfields is reviewed.\n", "authors": "David J.

Advanced stereo analysis techniques allow MAGIC to achieve a sensitivity\nas good as (0.76 +/- 0.03)% of the Crab Nebula flux in 50 h of observations\nabove 290 GeV. The angular resolution at those energies is better than ~0.07\ndegree.

Here we discuss a novel implementation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD) in the moving mesh code AREPO which combines many of the advantages of\nEulerian and Lagrangian methods in a single computational technique. The\nemployed grid is defined as the Voronoi tessellation of a set of\nmesh-generating points which can move along with the flow, yielding an\nautomatic adaptivity of the mesh and a substantial reduction of advection\nerrors. Our scheme solves the MHD Riemann problem in the rest frame of the\nVoronoi interfaces using the HLLD Riemann solver. To satisfy the divergence\nconstraint of the magnetic field in multiple dimensions, the Dedner divergence\ncleaning method is applied. In a set of standard test problems we show that the\nnew code produces accurate results, and that the divergence of the magnetic\nfield is kept sufficiently small to closely preserve the correct physical\nsolution. We also apply the code to two first application problems, namely\nsupersonic MHD turbulence and the spherical collapse of a magnetized cloud. We\nverify that the code is able to handle both problems well, demonstrating the\napplicability of this MHD version of AREPO to a wide range of problems in\nastrophysics.\n", "authors": "Ruediger Pakmor, Andreas Bauer, Volker Springel"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2011-08-09T00:39:37Z", "title": "Data Acquisition and Readout System for the LUX Dark Matter Experiment", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1836v2", "summary": "  LUX is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon time projection chamber designed to\ndetect nuclear recoils from interactions with dark matter particles.

The mask, consisting of an aluminum film on a glass\nsubstrate, was manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with electron\nbeam lithography. Careful evaluation of coronagraphic performance, including\nPSF subtraction, was carried out in air using the developed mask.

Drift-scan observing is not compatible with\nstandard beam calibration routines, and the situation is further complicated by\ndifficult-to-parametrize beam shapes and, at low frequencies, the sparsity of\naccurate source spectra to use as calibrators. We overcome these challenges by\nbuilding up an interrelated network of source \"crossing points\" -- locations\nwhere the primary beam is sampled by multiple sources. Using the single\nassumption that a beam has 180 degree rotational symmetry, we can achieve\nsignificant beam coverage with only a few tens of sources. The resulting\nnetwork of crossing points allows us to solve for both a beam model and source\nflux densities referenced to a single calibrator source, circumventing the need\nfor a large sample of well-characterized calibrators. We illustrate the method\nwith actual and simulated observations from the Precision Array for Probing the\nEpoch of Reionization (PAPER).\n", "authors": "Jonathan C. Pober, Aaron R.

The Dual Zone Phase Mask (DZPM)\ncoronagraph constitutes a promising concept since it theoretically offers a\nsmall inner working angle (IWA \\sim \\lambda_0/D), good achromaticity and high\nstarlight rejection, typically reaching a 1e6 contrast at 5 \\lambda_0/D from\nthe star over a spectral bandwidth \\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda_0 of 25% (similar to\nH-band). This last value proves to be encouraging for broadband imaging of\nyoung and warm Jupiter-like planets. Contrast levels higher than 1e6 are\nhowever required for the observation of older and/or less massive companions\nover a finite spectral bandwidth. An achromatization improvement of the DZPM\ncoronagraph is therefore mandatory to reach such performance. In its design,\nthe DZPM coronagraph uses a grey (or achromatic) apodization. We propose to\nreplace it by a colored apodization to increase the performance of this\ncoronagraphic system over a large spectral range. This innovative concept,\ncalled Colored Apodizer Phase Mask (CAPM) coronagraph, is defined with some\ndesign parameters optimized to reach the best contrast in the exoplanet search\narea. Once this done, we study the performance of the CAPM coronagraph in the\npresence of different errors to evaluate the sensitivity of our concept. A 2.5\nmag contrast gain is estimated from the performance provided by the CAPM\ncoronagraph with respect to that of the DZPM coronagraph. A 2.2e-8 intensity\nlevel at 5 \\lambda_0/D separation is then theoretically achieved with the CAPM\ncoronagraph in the presence of a clear circular aperture and a 25% bandwidth.\nIn addition, our studies show that our concept is less sensitive to low than\nhigh-order aberrations for a given value of rms wavefront errors.\n", "authors": "M.

This\ncauses the medium to expand locally and emit a shock wave with a\nmedium-dependent peak frequency on the order of 10 kHz. In South Pole ice in\nparticular, the elastic properties of the medium have been theorized to provide\ngood coupling of particle energy to acoustic energy. The acoustic attenuation\nlength has been theorized to be several km, which could enable a sparsely\ninstrumented large-volume detector to search for rare signals from high-energy\nastrophysical neutrinos. We simulated a hybrid optical/radio/acoustic extension\nto the IceCube array, specifically intended to detect cosmogenic (GZK)\nneutrinos with multiple methods simultaneously in order to achieve high\nconfidence in a discovered signal and to measure angular, temporal, and\nspectral distributions of GZK neutrinos.\n  This work motivated the design, deployment, and operation of the South Pole\nAcoustic Test Setup (SPATS). The main purpose of SPATS is to measure the\nacoustic attenuation length, sound speed profile, noise floor, and transient\nnoise sources \\emph{in situ} at the South Pole. We describe the design,\nperformance, and results from SPATS. We measured the sound speed in the fully\ndense ice between 200 m and 500 m depth to be 3878 $\\pm$ 12 m/s for pressure\nwaves and 1975.8 $\\pm$ 8.0 m/s for shear waves. We measured the acoustic\namplitude attenuation length to be 316 $\\pm$ 105 m. We measured the background\nnoise floor to be Gaussian and very stable on all time scales from one second\nto two years. Finally, we have detected an interesting set of\nwell-reconstructed transient events in over one year of high quality transient\ndata acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of what is next for SPATS and\nof the prospects for acoustic neutrino detection in ice.\n", "authors": "Justin Vandenbroucke"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2011-12-30T17:07:19Z", "title": "VAMDC as a Resource for Atomic and Molecular Data and the New Release of\n  VALD", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0154v1", "summary": "  The Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre (VAMDC) (M.L.

It is thus critical that the algorithm be able to take advantage of\ntrends in commodity computing hardware. With this goal in mind, we present\nanalysis of the 'direct', 'tree' and 'sub-band' dedispersion algorithms with\nrespect to their potential for efficient execution on modern graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs). We find all three to be excellent candidates, and\nproceed to describe implementations in C for CUDA using insight gained from the\nanalysis. Using recent CPU and GPU hardware, the transition to the GPU provides\na speed-up of 9x for the direct algorithm when compared to an optimised\nquad-core CPU code. For realistic recent survey parameters, these speeds are\nhigh enough that further optimisation is unnecessary to achieve real-time\nprocessing.

The mission concept\nuses a 3000 square centimeter effective area mirror (at 6 keV) to achieve\nunprecedented sensitivities for hard X-ray imaging spectrometry (5-70 keV) and\nfor broadband X-ray polarimetry (2-70 keV). BEST can make substantial\ncontributions to our understanding of the inner workings of accreting black\nholes, our knowledge about the fabric of extremely curved spacetime, and the\nevolution of supermassive black holes. BEST will allow for time resolved\nstudies of accretion disks. With a more than seven times larger mirror area and\na seven times wider bandpass than GEMS, BEST will take X-ray polarimetry to a\nnew level: it will probe the time variability of the X-ray polarization from\nstellar mass and supermassive black holes, and it will measure the polarization\nproperties in 30 independent energy bins. These capabilities will allow BEST to\nconduct tests of accretion disk models and the underlying spacetimes. With\nthree times larger mirror area and ten times better angular resolution than\nNuSTAR, BEST will be able to make deep field observations with a more than 15\ntimes better sensitivity than NuSTAR. The mission will be able to trace the\nevolution of obscured and unobscured black holes in the redshift range from\nzero to six, covering the most important epoch of supermassive black hole\ngrowth. The hard X-ray sensitivity of BEST will enable a deep census of\nnon-thermal particle populations. BEST will give us insights into AGN feedback\nby measuring the particle luminosity injected by AGNs into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) of their hosts, and will map the emission from particles\naccelerated at large scale structure shocks. Finally, BEST has the potential to\nconstrain the equation of state of neutron stars (NS).\n", "authors": "Henric Krawczynski, Jack Tueller, Scott Barthelmy, Jeremy Schnittman, William Zhang, Julian Krolik, Matthew G.

Adequate\nspectral smoothing is applied to the spectrum toward OFF-source blank sky\nadjacent to a target source direction for the purpose of bandpass correction.\nBecause the smoothing process reduces noise, the integration time for\nOFF-source scans can be reduced keeping the signal-to-noise ratio. Since the\nsmoothing is not applied to ON-source scans, the spectral resolution for line\nfeatures is kept. An optimal smoothing window is determined by bandpass\nflatness evaluated by Spectral Allan Variance (SAV). An efficient scan pattern\nis designed to the OFF-source scans within the bandpass stability timescale\nestimated by Time-based Allan Variance (TAV). We have tested the SBC using the\ndigital spectrometer, VESPA, on the VERA Iriki station. For the targeted noise\nlevel of 5e-4 as a ratio to the system noise, the optimal smoothing window was\n32 - 60 ch in the whole bandwidth of 1024 ch, and the optimal scan pattern was\ndesigned as a sequence of 70-s ON + 10-s OFF scan pairs. The noise level with\nthe SBC was reduced by a factor of 1.74 compared with the conventional method.\nThe total telescope time to achieve the goal with the SBC was 400 s, which was\n1/3 of 1200 s required by the conventional way. Improvement in telescope time\nefficiency with the SBC was calculated as 3x, 2x and 1.3x for single-beam,\ndual-beam, and on-the-fly (OTF) scans, respectively.

Rigorously, this result stands for a wide variety of\nconfigurations, as soon as the density structure is vertically homogeneous.\nNevertheless, the sensitivity to vertical stratification | the Gaussian profile\nhas been considered | appears weak provided that the surface density is\nconserved. For bodies with small aspect ratio (i.e. geometrically thin discs),\na first-order Taylor expansion furnishes an excellent approximation for this\nmean Green function, the absolute error being of the fourth order in the aspect\nratio. This formula is therefore well suited to studying the structure of\nself-gravitating discs and rings in the spirit of the \"standard model of thin\ndiscs\" where the vertical structure is often ignored, but it remains accurate\nfor discs and tori of finite thickness.

Here we show through simulation and theory that an adaptive pupil\nmask can be used to reduce these speckles and increase the visibility of faint\ncompanions. This is achieved by placing an adaptive mask in the conjugate pupil\nplane of the telescope. The mask consists of a number of independently\ncontrollable elements which can either allow the light in the subaperture to\npass or block it. This actively changes the shape of the telescope pupil and\nhence the diffraction pattern in the focal plane. By randomly blocking\nsubapertures we force the quasi-static speckles to become dynamic. The long\nexposure PSF is then smooth, absent of quasi-static speckles. However, as the\nPSF will now contain a larger halo due to the blocking, the signal to noise\nratio (SNR) is reduced requiring longer exposure times to detect the companion.\nFor example, in the specific case of a faint companion at 5xlambda/D the\nexposure time to achieve the same SNR will be increased by a factor of 1.35. In\naddition, we show that the visibility of companions can be greatly enhanced in\ncomparison to long-exposures, when the dark speckle method is applied to short\nexposure images taken with the adaptive pupil mask.

We find that iterative median smoothing produces the\nbest source finding results for ASKAP HI spectral line observations, but\nwavelet de-noising is a safer pre-processing technique.\n  In this paper we also present our implementations of iterative median\nsmoothing and mathematical morphology subtraction.\n", "authors": "Russell Jurek, Shea Brown"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2012-06-28T02:17:08Z", "title": "Suppression of the near-infrared OH night sky lines with fibre Bragg\n  gratings - first results", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6551v1", "summary": "  The background noise between 1 and 1.8 microns in ground-based instruments is\ndominated by atmospheric emission from hydroxyl molecules.

The most significant differences between the two telescopes include the\nfollowing: secondary mirror support changes, improvements in the optical\npolishing, changes in the optical coatings to improve throughput and decrease\nghosting, removal of heat sources inside the mirror cell, expansion of the\nprimary mirror figure control system, changes in the baffle designs, and an\nimproved cable wrap design. This paper gives a description of each of these\ndesign changes and discusses the motivations for making them.\n", "authors": "Jeffrey S.

We present the design of a broadband APP that yields two\nPSFs that have the opposite sides cleared out. Both properties are enabled by a\nhalf-wave liquid crystal layer, for which the local fast axis orientation over\nthe pupil is forced to follow the required phase structure. For each of the two\ncircular polarization states, the required phase apodization is thus obtained,\nand, moreover, the PSFs after a quarter-wave plate and a polarizing\nbeam-splitter are complementary due to the antisymmetric nature of the phase\napodization. The device can be achromatized in the same way as half-wave plates\nof the Pancharatnam type or by layering self-aligning twisted liquid crystals\nto form a monolithic film called a multi-twist retarder. As the VAPP introduces\na known phase diversity between the two PSFs, they may be used directly for\nwavefront sensing. By applying an additional quarter-wave plate in front, the\ndevice also acts as a regular polarizing beam-splitter, which therefore\nfurnishes high-contrast polarimetric imaging.

The proposed hydrodynamic scheme is validated using a variety of\nnumerical tests that cover important topics in astrophysics, such as the\nevolution of supernova remnants, the stability of self-gravitating bodies and\nthe coalescence of compact objects. The results suggest that the SPH scheme\nbuilt with the integral approach to the derivatives premise improves the\nresults of the standard SPH technique. In particular, it is observed a better\ndevelopment of hydrodynamic instabilities, an improved description of\nself-gravitant structures in equilibrium and a reasonable description of the\nprocess of coalescence of two white dwarfs. A good energy, and linear and\nangular momentum conservation, generally better than that of standard SPH, was\nalso obtained.

To try to break this relation alternative new technologies have been\nproposed, such as the use of the Integrated Photonic Spectrograph (IPS). Due to\ntheir diffraction limited nature the IPS is claimed to defeat the harsh scaling\nlaw applying to conventional instruments. The problem with astronomical\napplications is that unlike conventional photonics, they are not usually fed by\ndiffraction limited sources. This means in order to retain throughput and\nspatial information the IPS will require multiple Arrayed Waveguide Gratings\n(AWGs) and a photonic lantern. We investigate the implications of these extra\ncomponents on the size of the instrument. We also investigate the potential\nsize advantage of using an IPS as opposed to conventional monolithic optics. To\ndo this, we have constructed toy models of IPS and conventional image sliced\nspectrographs to calculate the relative instrument sizes and their requirements\nin terms of numbers of detector pixels. Using these models we can quantify the\nrelative size/cost advantage for different types of instrument, by varying\ndifferent parameters e.g. multiplex gain and spectral resolution. This is\naccompanied by an assessment of the uncertainties in these predictions, which\nmay prove crucial for the planning of future instrumentation for\nhighly-multiplexed spectroscopy.\n", "authors": "R.

Existing detection algorithms are commonly found to be\nunreliable in the case of IFS data and the optimal parameter settings are\nusually unknown a-priori for a given dataset. The CALIFA survey generates\nhundreds of IFS datasets for which a reliable and robust detection algorithm\nfor cosmics is required as an important part of the fully automatic CALIFA data\nreduction pipeline. We developed a novel algorithm, PyCosmic, which combines\nthe edge-detection algorithm of L.A.Cosmic with a point-spread function\nconvolution scheme. We generated mock data to compute the efficiency of\ndifferent algorithms for a wide range of characteristic fibre-fed IFS datasets\nusing the PMAS and VIMOS IFS instruments as representative cases. PyCosmic is\nthe only algorithm that achieves an acceptable detection performance for CALIFA\ndata. We find that PyCosmic is the most robust tool with a detection rate of\n>~90% and a false detection rate <5% for any of the tested IFS data. It has one\nless free parameter than the L.A.Cosmic algorithm. Only for strongly\nundersampled IFS data does L.A.Cosmic exceed the performance of PyCosmic by a\nfew per cent. DCR never reaches the efficiency of the other two algorithms and\nshould only be used if computational speed is a concern.

In late 2011 the Astrophysics Division augmented its\noriginal charge, asking for two design reference missions. The first of these,\nDRM1, was to be a finalized version of the interim DRM, reducing overall\nmission costs where possible. The second of these, DRM2, was to identify and\neliminate capabilities that overlapped with those of NASA's James Webb Space\nTelescope (henceforth JWST), ESA's Euclid mission, and the NSF's ground-based\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope (henceforth LSST), and again to reduce overall\nmission cost, while staying faithful to NWNH.

Finally, a single radio\nantenna on the lunar lander would pave the way for a future large lunar radio\ninterferometer; not only will it demonstrate the possibilities for lunar radio\nscience and open up the last unexplored radio regime, but it will also allow a\ndetermination of the limitations of lunar radio science by measuring the local\nradio background noise.\n", "authors": "Marc Klein Wolt, Amin Aminaei, Philippe Zarka, Jan-Rutger Schrader, Albert-Jan Boonstra, Heino Falcke"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2012-09-14T19:44:14Z", "title": "A near infrared frequency comb for Y+J band astronomical spectroscopy", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3295v1", "summary": "  Radial velocity (RV) surveys supported by high precision wavelength\nreferences (notably ThAr lamps and I2 cells) have successfully identified\nhundreds of exoplanets; however, as the search for exoplanets moves to cooler,\nlower mass stars, the optimum wave band for observation for these objects moves\ninto the near infrared (NIR) and new wavelength standards are required.

However, it is difficult to make metal mesh surfaces with\nsufficient radio-frequency (RF) performance for frequencies higher than\nmillimeter waves. In this paper, we present the RF performance of metal mesh\nsurfaces at 43 GHz. For this purpose, we developed an apparatus to measure the\nreflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and radiative coefficient of\nthe mesh surface. The reflection coefficient increases as a function of metal\nmesh surface tension, whereas the radiative coefficient decreases. The\nanisotropic aspects of the reflection coefficient and the radiative coefficient\nare also clearly seen. They depend on the front and back sides of the metal\nmesh surface and the rotation angle. The transmission coefficient was measured\nto be almost constant. The measured radiative coefficients and transmission\ncoefficients would cause significant degradation of the system noise\ntemperature. In addition, we carried out an astronomical observation of a\nwell-known SiO maser source, R Cas, by using a metal mesh mirror on the NRO\n45-m radio telescope Coude system.

Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI)\nsituation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz\nwith low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a\nsubset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed\nwith a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the\nlow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. These values are\nfound to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day\nand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find\nthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR\nresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of\n0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. This rate increases\napproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.\nConclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR\nradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It\nremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that\nintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for\nthe low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR;\naccurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the\nproximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be\nused once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the\nfrequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB\nstations and windmills.\n", "authors": "A. R. Offringa, A. G. de Bruyn, S.

The\nsignature of primordial gravitational waves, which give rise to a B-type\npolarization, is one of the goals in cosmology today and amongst the first\nobjectives in the field.

To\ntry to break this relation alternative new technologies have been proposed,\nsuch as the use of the Integrated Photonic Spectrograph (IPS). Due to their\ndiffraction-limited nature the IPS is claimed to defeat the harsh scaling law\napplying to conventional instruments. In contrast to photonic applications,\ndevices for astronomy are not usually used at the diffraction limit. Therefore\nto retain throughput and spatial information, the IPS requires a photonic\nlantern (PL) to decompose the input multimode light into single modes. This is\nthen fed into either numerous Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) or a\nconventional spectrograph. We investigate the potential advantage of using an\nIPS instead of conventional monolithic optics for a variety of capabilities\nrepresented by existing instruments and others planned for Extremely Large\nTelescopes. We show that a full IPS instrument is equivalent to an\nimage-slicer. However, the requirement to decompose the input light into\nindividual modes imposes a redundancy in terms of the numbers of components and\ndetector pixels in many cases which acts to cancel out the advantage of the\nsmall size of the photonic components. However, there are specific applications\nwhere an IPS gives a potential advantage which we describe.

The ability to estimate planetary intensities in as little as\nfew seconds has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of exoplanet\nsearch surveys. Unlike currently used methods, in which increasing the\nobservation time beyond a certain threshold is useless, this method produces\nestimates whose error covariances decrease more quickly than inversely\nproportional to the observation time.

This paper\nillustrates the effects of two-stage beamforming on sidelobes and effective\narea, for two representative station layouts (regular and irregular gridded\ntile on an irregular station). The performance is compared with a single-stage,\nirregular station. The inner sidelobe levels do not change significantly\nbetween layouts, but the more distant sidelobes are affected by the tile\nlayouts; regular tile creates diffuse, but regular, grating lobes.

Aperture Arrays re-entered the world of radio astronomy as\nthe idea to build a huge radio telescope with a collecting area of one square\nkilometre (the Square Kilometre Array, SKA) arose. Huge ICT technology advances\nhad transformed Aperture Arrays in terms of their capability, flexibility and\nreliability. In the mid-1990s, ASTRON started to develop and experiment with\nthe first high frequency aperture array tiles for radio astronomy - AAD, OSMA,\nTHEA & EMBRACE. In the slipstream of these efforts, Phased Array Feeds (PAFs)\nfor radio astronomy were invented and LOFAR itself emerged as a next generation\ntelescope and a major pathfinder for the SKA. Meanwhile, the same advantages\nthat aperture arrays offered to radio astronomy had already made dishes\nobsolete in many different civilian and military applications. The first\ncommissioning results from LOFAR and other Aperture Arrays (MWA, LWA and PAPER)\ncurrently demonstrate that this kind of technology can transform radio\nastronomy over 2 decades of the radio spectrum, and at frequencies up to at\nleast 1.5 GHz.

Their particular strength lies in the multi-TeV to ultra high\nenergy range (E > 30 TeV), where large effective areas, yet small light\nsensitive areas per detector station are needed. To exploit this potential to\nfull extent, a large station spacing is required to achieve a large effective\narea at a reasonable effort. In such a detector, the low number of signals per\nevent, the absence of imaging information, and the poor signal to noise ratio\nof Cherenkov light to night sky brightness pose considerable challenges for the\nevent reconstruction, especially the gamma hadron separation. The event\nreconstruction presented in this paper has been developed for the wide-angle\ndetector HiSCORE, but the concepts may be applied more generically. It is\ntested on simulated data in the 10 TeV to 5 PeV energy range. For the tests, a\nregular grid of 22 x 22 detector stations with a spacing of 150 m is assumed,\ncovering an area of 10 km^2. The angular resolution of individual events is\nfound to be about 0.3 degree near the energy threshold, improving to below 0.1\ndegree at higher energies. The relative energy resolution is 20% at the\nthreshold and improves to 10% at higher energies. Several parameters for gamma\nhadron separation are described. With a combination of these parameters, 80% to\n90% of the hadronic background can be suppressed, while about 60% of the\ngamma-ray events are retained. The point source sensitivity to gamma-ray\nsources is estimated, with conservative assumptions, to be about 8 x 10^(-13)\nerg / s / cm^2 at 100 TeV gamma-ray for a 10 km^2 array. With more optimistic\nassumptions, and a 100 km^2 array, a sensitivity of about 1 x 10^(-13) erg / s\n/ cm^2 can be achieved (at 100 TeV).\n", "authors": "Daniel Hampf, Martin Tluczykont, Dieter Horns"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2013-02-19T22:02:09Z", "title": "An Algorithm for Precise Aperture Photometry of Critically Sampled\n  Images", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4764v1", "summary": "  We present an algorithm for performing precise aperture photometry on\ncritically sampled astrophysical images.

The\nmeasurement must however overcome astrometric distortions which are much larger\nthan the photon noise limit. To address this issue, we propose to generate\nfaint stellar diffraction spikes using a two-dimensional grid of regularly\nspaced small dark spots added to the surface of the primary mirror (PM).\nAccurate astrometric motion of the host star is obtained by comparing the\nposition of the spikes to the background field stars. The spikes do not\ncontribute to scattered light in the central part of the field and therefore\nallow unperturbed coronagraphic observation of the star's immediate\nsurrounding. Because the diffraction spikes are created on the PM and imaged on\nthe same focal plane detector as the background stars, astrometric distortions\naffect equally the diffraction spikes and the background stars, and are\ntherefore calibrated. We describe the technique, detail how the data collected\nby the wide-field camera are used to derive astrometric motion, and identify\nthe main sources of astrometric error using numerical simulations and\nanalytical derivations.

Processing several years of data simultaneously requires\ncomputing not only the solution of a large system of equations, but also the\nassociated uncertainties. We aim at reducing the computation time and the\nmemory usage. Since the SPI transfer function is sparse, we have used some\npopular methods for the solution of large sparse linear systems; we briefly\nreview these methods. We use the Multifrontal Massively Parallel Solver (MUMPS)\nto compute the solution of the system of equations. We also need to compute the\nvariance of the solution, which amounts to computing selected entries of the\ninverse of the sparse matrix corresponding to our linear system.

In practice, various instrumental perturbations can degrade the\nnulling performance. Any imperfection in phase, amplitude, or polarization\nproduces a spurious flux that leaks to the interferometer output and corrupts\nthe transmitted off-axis flux. One of these instrumental pertubations is the\ncrosstalk phenomenon, which occurs because of multiple parasitic reflections\ninside transmitting optics, and/or diffraction effects related to beam\npropagation along finite size optics. It can include a crosstalk of a beam with\nitself, and a mutual crosstalk between different beams. This can create a\nparasitic interference pattern, which degrades the intrinsic transmission map -\nor intensity response - of the interferometer. In this context, we describe how\nthis instrumental effect impairs the performance of a Bracewell interferometer.\nA simple formalism is developed to derive the corresponding modified intensity\nresponse of the interferometer, as a function of the two parameters of\ninterest: the crosstalk level (or contamination rate) and the phase shift\nbetween the primary and secondary - parasitic - beams.

In this paper, we advance a novel optical setup which\nsynthesizes the advantages of two different techniques: nulling interferometry\nto mitigate photon noise, and closure phase to combat optical aberrations. Our\ndesign, which employs technology from integrated optics and photonics, is\nintended to combine the advantageous aspects of both a coronagraph and a\nnon-redundant interferometer inside a single optical device.

But residual quasi-static aberrations create\nspeckles in the focal plane downstream of the coronagraph which mask the\nplanet. This problem appears in ground-based instruments as well as in\nspace-based telescopes. An active correction of these wavefront errors using a\ndeformable mirror upstream of the coronagraph is mandatory, but conventional\nadaptive optics are limited by differential path aberrations. Dedicated\ntechniques have to be implemented to measure phase and amplitude errors\ndirectly in the science focal plane. First, we propose a method for estimating\nphase and amplitude aberrations upstream of a coronagraph from the speckle\ncomplex field in the downstream focal plane. Then, we present the self-coherent\ncamera, which uses the coherence of light to spatially encode the focal plane\nspeckles and retrieve the associated complex field.

We revisit the\nimpact of this effect on imaging quality and study a new algorithmic strategy\nto deal with the associated operator in the image reconstruction process. In\nprevious studies it has been shown that image recovery in the framework of\ncompressed sensing is improved due to the spread spectrum effect, where the\nw-modulation can act to increase the incoherence between measurement and\nsparsifying signal representations. For the purpose of computational\nefficiency, idealised experiments were performed, where only a constant\nbaseline component w in the pointing direction of the telescope was considered.\nWe extend this analysis to the more realistic setting where the w-component\nvaries for each visibility measurement. Firstly, incorporating varying\nw-components into imaging algorithms is a computational demanding task. We\npropose a variant of the w-projection algorithm for this purpose, which is\nbased on an adaptive sparsification procedure, and incorporate it in compressed\nsensing imaging methods. This sparse matrix variant of the w-projection\nalgorithm is generic and adapts to the support of each kernel. Consequently, it\nis applicable for all types of direction-dependent effects.

The ratio of their\nbrightnesses, as recorded by the CCD, along with geometric factors, provides an\nestimate of the dish reflectivity with few systematic errors. A filter wheel is\nplaced in front of the CCD camera, allowing to measure the reflectivity as a\nfunction of wavelength.

It is useful in the cases when the data may contain several\nperiodic components, especially when their interaction with each other and with\nthe data sampling patterns might produce misleading results.\n  Although the multi-frequency statistic itself was already constructed, e.g.\nby G. Foster in his CLEANest algorithm, its probabilistic properties (the\ndetection significance levels) are still poorly known and much of what is\ndeemed known is unrigourous. These detection levels are nonetheless important\nfor the data analysis. We argue that to prove the simultaneous existence of all\n$n$ components revealed in a multi-periodic variation, it is mandatory to apply\nat least $2^n-1$ significance tests, among which the most involves various\nmulti-frequency statistics, and only $n$ tests are single-frequency ones.\n  The main result of the paper is an analytic estimation of the statistical\nsignificance of the frequency tuples that the multi-frequency periodogram can\nreveal. Using the theory of extreme values of random fields (the generalized\nRice method), we find a handy approximation to the relevant false alarm\nprobability. For the double-frequency periodogram this approximation is given\nby an elementary formula $\\frac{\\pi}{16} W^2 e^{-z} z^2$, where $W$ stands for\na normalized width of the settled frequency range, and $z$ is the observed\nperiodogram maximum. We carried out intensive Monte Carlo simulations to show\nthat the practical quality of this approximation is satisfactory. A similar\nanalytic expression for the general multi-frequency periodogram is also given\nin the paper, though with a smaller amount of numerical verification.\n", "authors": "Roman V.

The theory on which the technique is based is validated\nby laboratory experiments. Its outstanding principal advantages comes from the\nfact that the angular structure of an astronomical object is simply determined\nfrom the visibility of the minima of the spectrum of the intensity fluctuations\nmeasured by the detector, as a function of the frequency of the fluctuations,\nwhile keeping the spacing between mirrors constant. This would allow a simple\nsetup capable of high angular resolutions because it could use an extremely\nlarge baseline. Another major interest is that it allows for a more efficient\nuse of telescope time because observations at a single baseline are sufficient,\nwhile amplitude and intensity interferometers need several observations at\ndifferent baselines. The fact that one does not have to move the telescopes\nwould also allow detecting faster time variations because having to move the\ntelescopes sets a lower limit to the time variations that can be detected. The\ntechnique uses wave interaction effects and thus has some characteristics in\ncommon with intensity interferometry. A disadvantage of the technique, like in\nintensity interferometry, is that it needs strong sources if observing at high\nfrequencies (e.g. the visible). This is a minor disadvantage in the radio\nregion. At high frequencies, this disadvantage is mitigated by the fact that,\nlike in intensity interferometry, the requirements of the optical quality of\nthe mirrors used are far less severe than in amplitude interferometry so that\npoor quality large reflectors (e.g. Cherenkov telescopes) can be used in the\noptical region.\n", "authors": "Ermanno F.

Starting from the present calibration status, the\ncharacterization and correction for instrumental effects affecting the relative\ncalibration accuracy is described and an outlook for the final achievable\ncalibration numbers is given. After including all the correction for the\ninstrumental effects, the relative photometric calibration accuracy\n(repeatability) will be as good as 0.5% in the blue and green band and 2% in\nthe red band. This excellent calibration starts to reveal possible\ninconsistencies between the models of the K-type and the M-type stellar\ncalibrators.

This approach relies on an analytic expression for\nthe contribution of a pixel in the image to the observed visibilities, and the\nwell-known expression for Dirac delta function pixels is used along with two\nnew approximations for Gaussian pixels, which allow for multi-scale\ndeconvolution. The algorithm is similar to the CLEAN algorithm in that it fits\nthe reconstructed pixels in the image to the observed visibilities while\nminimising the total flux; however, unlike CLEAN, it operates on the ungridded\nvisibilities, enforces positivity, and has guaranteed global convergence.

The binary\nseparation during our observations ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 times the diffraction\nlimit of the telescope at the central wavelength. We successfully resolved the\nCapella binary system with an astrometric precision as good as 1mas under the\nbest observing conditions. FIRST also gives access to the spectral flux ratio\nbetween the two components directly measured with an unprecedented spectral\nresolution (around 300) over the 600-850nm range. In particular, our data allow\nto detect the well-known overall slope of the flux ratio spectrum, leading to\nan estimation of the pivot wavelength of 0.64+/-0.01um, at which the cooler\ncomponent becomes the brightest. Spectral features arising from the difference\nin effective temperature (specifically the Halpha line, TiO and CN bands) have\nbeen used to constrain the stellar parameters. The effective temperatures we\nderive for both components are slightly lower (5-7%) than the well-established\nproperties for this system. This difference mainly originates from deeper\nmolecular features than those predicted by state-of-the-art stellar atmospheric\nmodels, suggesting that molecular line lists used in the photospheric models\nare incomplete and/or oscillator strengths are underestimated (most likely\nconcerning the CN molecule). These results demonstrate the power of FIRST, a\nfibered pupil remapping based instrument, in terms of high angular resolution\nand show that the direct measurement of the spectral flux ratio provides\nvaluable information to characterize little known companions.\n", "authors": "E.

Both of these methods have their\ndrawbacks, including needing to open the telescope at night or waiting for the\nvery rare occurrence of a solar transit, which the telescope may not even be in\na position to observe. Additionally, assessing the accuracy of these methods\ncan be difficult. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the feasibility of\nan idea proposed by the faculty of the Institute for Solar Physics at Stockholm\nUniversity, that would allow us to routinely calibrate the image scale of the\nSST when desired and with known accuracy of the measurement, without the need\nto open the telescope at night. The measurements performed so far are\nconsistent with the old value to about one third of a percent, with a total\nuncertainty of the SST/CRISP image scale of about 0.1 percent. Resulting in a\ngrid spacing of the pinhole array of 5.15 arcseconds, which can be used to\ndetermine the image scale of all the remaining science cameras of the SST.\n", "authors": "Alexander Nor\u00e9n"}, {"category": "astro-ph.IM", "pubdate": "2013-11-21T01:01:41Z", "title": "RESOLVE: A new algorithm for aperture synthesis imaging of extended\n  emission in radio astronomy", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5282v1", "summary": "  We present RESOLVE, a new algorithm for radio aperture synthesis imaging of\nextended and diffuse emission in total intensity.

One method for obtaining the\nbest possible flat fielding accuracy is to derive a photometric model from\ndithered stellar observations. A large variety of effects have been taken into\naccount in such modelling. Recently, Moehler et al. (2010) discovered\nsystematic variations in available flat frames for the European Southern\nObservatory's FORS instrument that change with the orientation of the projected\nimage on the sky. The effect on photometry is large compared to other\nsystematic effects that have already been taken into account.

The technique is\ndemonstrated using data recorded at the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope and the\n1.0 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, both on La Palma.\n", "authors": "H. W. Shepherd, J. Osborn, R. W.

As in the case of other\ncomposite materials, the NbSi properties can be changed by varying the relative\namounts of its components. Using a NbSi film with T_c around 1 K we have been\nable to obtain the first NbSi resonators, observe an optical response and\nacquire a spectrum in the band 50 to 300 GHz. The data taken show that this\nmaterial has very high kinetic inductance and normal state surface resistivity.\nThese properties are ideal for the development of KID. More measurements are\nplanned to further characterize the NbSi alloy and fully investigate its\npotential.\n", "authors": "M. Calvo, A. D'Addabbo, A. Monfardini, A. Benoit, N. Boudou, O.
