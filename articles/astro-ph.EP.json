We consider situations in which the giant planet\nhalts migration at semi-major axes in the range 0.13 - 1.7 AU due to gas disk\ndispersal. An N-body code is employed that is linked to a viscous gas disk\nalgorithm capable of simulating: gas loss via accretion onto the central star\nand photoevaporation; gap formation by the giant planet; type II migration of\nthe giant; optional type I migration of protoplanets; gas drag on\nplanetesimals. We find that most of the inner system planetary building blocks\nsurvive the passage of the giant planet, either by being shepherded inward or\nscattered into exterior orbits. Systems of one or more hot-Earths are predicted\nto form and remain interior to the giant planet, especially if type II\nmigration has been limited, or where type I migration has affected\nprotoplanetary dynamics. Habitable planets in low eccentricity warm-Jupiter\nsystems appear possible if the giant planet makes a limited incursion into the\nouter regions of the habitable zone (HZ), or traverses its entire width and\nceases migrating at a radial distance of less than half that of the HZ's inner\nedge. We conclude that Type II migration does not prevent terrestrial planet\nformation.\n", "authors": "M. J. Fogg, R. P.

We test the hypothesis\nthat the offset is the result of true polar wander (TPW), the motion of the\nsolid surface with respect to the spin axis, caused by a mass redistribution\nwithin or on the surface of Mars. In particular, we consider TPW driven by\nlate-stage volcanism during the late Hesperian to Amazonian. There is\nobservational and qualitative support for this hypothesis: in both North and\nSouth, observed offsets lie close to a great circle 90 degrees from Tharsis, as\nexpected for polar wander after Tharsis formed. We calculate the magnitude and\ndirection of TPW produced by mapped late-stage lavas for a range of\nlithospheric thicknesses, lava thicknesses, eruption histories, and prior polar\nwander events. If Tharsis formed close to the equator, the stabilizing effect\nof a fossil rotational bulge located close to the equator leads to predicted\nTPW of <2 degrees, too small to account for observed offsets. If, however,\nTharsis formed far from the equator, late-stage TPW driven by low-latitude,\nlate-stage volcanism would be 6-33 degrees, similar to that inferred from the\nlocation of paleopolar deposits. 4.4+/-1.3x10^19 kg of young erupted lava can\naccount for the offset of the Dorsa Argentea Formation from the present-day\nsouth rotation pole. This mass is consistent with prior mapping-based estimates\nand would imply a mass release of CO2 by volcanic degassing similar to that in\nthe atmosphere at the present time. The South Polar Layered Deposits are offset\nfrom the spin axis in the opposite sense to the other paleopolar deposits. This\ncan be explained by an additional contribution from a plume beneath Elysium. We\nconclude with a list of observational tests of the TPW hypothesis.\n", "authors": "Edwin S.

Therefore, such a\nclose-in extrasolar planet is not protected by an extended magnetosphere. (b)\nThe small orbital distance of the planet exposes it to a much denser stellar\nwind than that prevailing at larger orbital distances. This dense stellar wind\nleads to additional compression of the magnetosphere, which can further reduce\nthe shielding efficiency against GCRs.

Instead, the weak\nshielding of M star planets can be attributed to their small magnetic moment.\nWe further analyse how the planetary mass and composition influence the\nplanetary magnetic moment, and thus modify the cosmic ray shielding efficiency.\nWe show that more massive planets are not necessarily better protected against\ngalactic cosmic rays, but that the planetary bulk composition can play an\nimportant role.\n", "authors": "J. -M.

In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass.

However, the issue of\nthe stability of these structures to the imposition of 3D disturbances is still\nnot fully understood, and it casts doubts on their long term survival.\n  Aim: We present new results on the 3D stability of elliptical vortices\nembedded in accretion discs, based on a linear analysis and several non-linear\nsimulations.\n  Methods: We derive the linearised equations governing the 3D perturbations in\nthe core of an elliptical vortex, and we show that they can be reduced to a\nFloquet problem.

We find that the median R-band albedo of these small Jovian Trojans\nis about 0.12, much higher than that of \"large\" Trojans with D > 57 km (0.04).\nAlso the range of albedos among the small Trojans is wider. We attribute the\nTrojan albedos to an evolutionary effect: the small Trojans are more likely to\nbe collisional fragments and so their surfaces would be younger. A younger\nsurface means less cumulative exposure to the space environment, which suggests\nthat their surfaces would not be as dark as those of the large, primordial\nTrojans. In support of this hypothesis is a statistically significant\ncorrelation of higher albedo with smaller diameter in our sample alone and in a\nsample that includes the larger Trojans.\n", "authors": "Y.

In this paper we propose a different formation scenario for Haumea's\ncollisional family. In our scenario the family members are ejected while in\norbit around Haumea. This scenario, therefore, gives naturally rise to a lower\nvelocity dispersion among the family members than expected from direct ejection\nfrom Haumea's surface.

By\ncombining aerosol distribution models (with hypothetical condensation at low\naltitudes) to surface models, we find the following results: (1) Aerosol-only\natmospheres should cause no loss and are essentially transparent for Cassini\nradar, as expected by former analysis. (2) However, if clouds are present, some\natmospheric models generate significant attenuation that can reach $-50 dB$,\nwell below the sensitivity threshold of the receiver. In such cases, a $13.78\nGHz$ radar would not be able to measure echoes coming from the surface. We thus\nwarn about possible risks of misinterpretation if a \\textquotedblleft wet\natmosphere\\textquotedblright $ $is not taken into account.

Theoretical modeling, on the other hand, raises several\nquestions. Firstly, dust coagulation occurs so rapidly, that if the small dust\ngrains are not replenished by collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates,\nmost disks should be observed to be dust poor, which is not the case. Secondly,\nif dust aggregates grow to sizes of the order of centimeters to meters, they\ndrift so fast inwards, that they are quickly lost.\n  Aims: We attempt to verify if collisional fragmentation of dust aggregates is\neffective enough to keep disks 'dusty' by replenishing the population of small\ngrains and by preventing excessive radial drift.\n  Methods: With a new and sophisticated implicitly integrated coagulation and\nfragmentation modeling code, we solve the combined problem of coagulation,\nfragmentation, turbulent mixing and radial drift and at the same time solve for\nthe 1-D viscous gas disk evolution.\n  Results: We find that for a critical collision velocity of 1 m/s, as\nsuggested by laboratory experiments, the fragmentation is so effective, that at\nall times the dust is in the form of relatively small particles. This means\nthat radial drift is small and that large amounts of small dust particles\nremain present for a few million years, as observed.

Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4.

Here, we simulate transit light\ncurves from Kepler-like photometry and ground-based observations in the\nnear-infrared (NIR) to determine how jointly modeling space-based and\nground-based light curves can improve measurements of the transit duration and\nplanet-star radius ratio. We find that adding observations of at least one\nground-based transit to space-based observations can significantly improve the\naccuracy for measuring the transit duration and planet-star radius ratio of\nsmall planets (R_p less than approximately 4 Earth radii) in long-period (~1\nyear) orbits, largely thanks to the reduced effect of limb darkening in the\nNIR. We also demonstrate that multiple ground-based observations are needed to\ngain a substantial improvement in the measurement accuracy for small planets\nwith short orbital periods (~3 days). Finally, we consider the role that higher\nground-based precisions will play in constraining parameter measurements for\ntypical Kepler targets.

The average thermal inertia is estimated to be 20+/-15\nMKS, potentially with significant surface heterogeneity. This first\nthermal-inertia measurement for a Trojan asteroid indicates a surface covered\nin fine regolith. The diameters of Patroclus and Menoetius are 106 +/- 11 and\n98+/-10 km, respectively, in agreement with previous findings. Taken together\nwith the system's known total mass, this implies a bulk mass density of 1.08\n+/-0.33 g/cm3, significantly below the mass density of L4-Trojan asteroid (624)\nHektor and suggesting a bulk composition dominated by water ice.\n", "authors": "Michael Mueller, Franck Marchis, Joshua P.

A basic assumption of this\nwork is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion of\nterrestrial planet formation, such as in the models that link the former to the\norigin of the Late Heavy Bombardment. The divergent migration of Jupiter and\nSaturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk with\nk ranging from 1 to 4. Consequently these secular resonances cause\nlarge-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets.

While the former determines the location of the habitable\nzone (HZ), the latter affects the dynamics of the material from which\nterrestrial planets are formed (i.e., planetesimals and planetary embryos), and\ndrives the final architecture of the planets assembly. In order for a habitable\nplanet to form in a binary star system, these two factors have to work in\nharmony. That is, the orbital dynamics of the two stars and their interactions\nwith the planet-forming material have to allow terrestrial planet formation in\nthe habitable zone, and ensure that the orbit of a potentially habitable planet\nwill be stable for long times. We have organized this chapter with the same\norder in mind. We begin by presenting a general discussion on the motion of\nplanets in binary stars and their stability.

The method makes use of a glass cell filled\nwith ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the \"iodine\ncell\" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar\nspectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a\nDoppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell,\nconvolved with a variable instrumental profile model. A complicating factor is\nthat a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the\nspectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric\nlines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a\ntime-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters\nin the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the\ninstrumental profile, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the\natmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift.\nTests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for\nlate M dwarfs over six months demonstrate that precisions of ~5 m/s are\nobtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m/s can be\nobtained over timescales up to a week.

The duration of the pre-collapse stage\nis inversely proportional roughly to the square of the planetary mass, so\nmassive protoplanets have shorter pre-collapse timescales and therefore limited\nopportunity for planetesimal capture. The available accretion time for\nprotoplanets with masses of 3, 5, 7, and 10 Jupiter masses is found to be\n7.82E4, 2.62E4, 1.17E4 and 5.67E3 years, respectively. The total mass that can\nbe captured by the protoplanets depends on the planetary mass, planetesimal\nsize, the radial distance of the protoplanet from the parent star, and the\nlocal solid surface density. We consider three radial distances, 24, 38, and 68\nAU, similar to the radial distances of the planets in the system HR 8799, and\nestimate the mass of heavy elements that can be accreted. We find that for the\nplanetary masses usually adopted for the HR 8799 system, the amount of heavy\nelements accreted by the planets is small, leaving them with nearly stellar\ncompositions.\n", "authors": "R.

The central\nwavelengths and areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron pyroxene-olivine absorption\nbands that are characteristic of planetary basalts are measured for both the\nasteroidal and meteoritic data. The band centers are shown to be well\ncorrelated, however the ratio of areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron absorption\nbands are much larger for the asteroids than for the meteorites. We argue that\nthis offset in band area ratio is consistent with our currently limited\nunderstanding of the effects of space weathering, however we can not rule out\nthe possibility that this offset is due to compositional differences. Several\nother possible causes of this offset are discussed.\n  Amongst these inner Main Belt asteroids we do not find evidence for\nnon-Vestoid mineralogies. Instead, these asteroids seem to represent a\ncontinuum of compositions, consistent with an origin from a single\ndifferentiated parent body. In addition, our analysis shows that V-type\nasteroids with low inclinations (i < 6 degrees) tend to have band centers\nslightly shifted towards long wavelengths. This may imply that more than one\ncollision on Vesta's surface was responsible for producing the observed\npopulation of inner belt V-type asteroids.

It is known that the system with more\nthan two planets becomes unstable after remaining quasi-stable for long times,\nleading to highly eccentric orbital motions or ejections of some of the\nplanets. In this paper, we are concerned with the underlying physics for this\nquasi-stability as well as the subsequent instability and advocate the\nso-called \"stagnant motion\" in the phase space, which has been explored in the\nfield of dynamical system. We employ the Lyapunov exponent, the power spectra\nof orbital elements and the distribution of the durations of quasi-stable\nmotions to analyze the phase space structure of the three-planet system, the\nsimplest and hopefully representative one that shows the instability. We find\nfrom the Lyapunov exponent that the system is almost non-chaotic in the initial\nquasi-stable state whereas it becomes intermittently chaotic thereafter. The\nnon-chaotic motions produce the horizontal dense band in the action-angle plot\nwhereas the voids correspond to the chaotic motions. We obtain power laws for\nthe power spectra of orbital eccentricities. Power-law distributions are also\nfound for the durations of quasi-stable states. All these results combined\ntogether, we may reach the following picture: the phase space consists of the\nso-called KAM tori surrounded by satellite tori and imbedded in the chaotic\nsea. The satellite tori have a self-similar distribution and are responsible\nfor the scale-free power-law distributions of the duration times. The system is\ntrapped around one of the KAM torus and the satellites for a long time (the\nstagnant motion) and moves to another KAM torus with its own satellites from\ntime to time, corresponding to the intermittent chaotic behaviors.\n", "authors": "Bungo Shikita, Hiroko Koyama, Shoichi Yamada"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2010-03-17T20:00:02Z", "title": "The NASA-UC Eta-Earth Program: II.

However, at some point the runaway body dynamically heats its\nenvironment, gravitational focusing factors decrease, and runaway growth passes\ninto oligarchic growth. Based on the results of recent simulations, we\nreconsider the runaway growth-oligarchy transition. In contrast to oligarchy,\nwe find that runaway growth cannot be approximated with a two component model\n(of small and large bodies) and that the criterion of Ida & Makino (1993),\nwhich is frequently adopted as the start of oligarchy, is not a sufficient\ncondition to signify the transition. Instead, we propose a new criterion based\non timescale arguments. We then find a larger value for the runaway\ngrowth-oligarchy transition: from several hundreds of km in the inner disk\nregions up to ~10^3 km for the outer disk. These findings are consistent with\nthe view that runaway growth has been responsible for the size distribution of\nthe present day Kuiper belt objects.

Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed\nvalue of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a uniform\ndistribution between zero and unity (corresponding to an isotropic i\ndistribution). The actual distribution from which it is drawn depends on the\nintrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being studied. We\ngive a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several\n\"toy models\" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of M_T. The\nresults show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for\nsimple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in an\nobserved RV sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 value\nfor an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quite\nplausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively. Over the same range of\nindicies, the 95% confidence upper bound on M_T ranges from 4.5 to 400 times\nlarger than M_T sin(i), respectively, due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More\ncomplex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of M_T yield still more\ncomplicated and less intuitive $sin(i)$ distributions. In particular, if the\nM_T distribution contains any characteristic mass scale M_c, the sin(i)\ndistribution will depend on the ratio of M_T sin(i) to $M_c$, often in a\nnon-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,\nboth individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)\nfactor as more than a \"numerical constant of order unity\" with simple and well\nunderstood statistical properties.

We consider the effect of\nforced turbulent mixing in the radiative layer, which could be driven by\natmospheric circulation or by another mechanism. Due to stable stratification\nin the atmosphere, forced turbulence drives a downward flux of heat. Weak\nturbulent mixing slows the cooling rate by this process, as if the planet was\nirradiated more intensely. Stronger turbulent mixing buries heat into the\nconvective interior, provided the turbulence extends to the\nradiative-convective boundary. This inflates the planet until a balance is\nreached between the heat buried into and radiated from the interior. We also\ninclude the direct injection of heat due to the dissipation of turbulence or\nother effects. Such heating is already known to slow planetary cooling. We find\nthat dissipation also enhances heat burial from mixing by lowering the\nthreshold for turbulent mixing to drive heat into the interior. Strong\nturbulent mixing of heavy molecular species such as TiO may be necessary to\nexplain stratospheric thermal inversions. We show that the amount of mixing\nrequired to loft TiO may overinflate the planet by our mechanism. This possible\nrefutation of the TiO hypothesis deserves further study. Our inflation\nmechanism requires a deep stratified layer that only exists when the absorbed\nstellar flux greatly exceeds the intrinsic emitted flux.

The purpose of the\npaper is to determine for the first time and with precision its\nprecession-nutation motion. We adopt an Hamiltonian formalism of the motion of\nrotation of rigid celestial body set up by Kinoshita (1977) based on Andoyer\nvariables and canonical equations. First we calculate Phoebe's obliquity at\nJ2000,0 from available astronomical data as well as the gravitational\nperturbation due to Saturn on Phoebe rotational motion. Then we carry out a\nnumerical integration and we compare our results for the precession rate and\nthe nutation coefficients with pure analytical model. Our results for Phoebe\nobliquity (23{\\deg}95) and Phoebe precession rate (5580\".65/cy) are very close\nto the respective values for the Earth. Moreover the amplitudes of the\nnutations (26\" peak to peak for the nutaton in longitude and 8\" for the\nnutation in obliquity) are of the same order as the respective amplitudes for\nthe Earth. We give complete tables of nutation, obtained from a FFT analysis\nstarting from the numerical signals. We show that a pure analytical model of\nthe nutation is not accurate due to the fact that Phoebe orbital elements e, M\nand Ls are far from having a simple linear behaviour. The precession and\nnutation of Phoebe have been calculated for the first time in this paper.

Among other\nscenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through\nplanet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded\nplanets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,\nplanet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the\nobserved high eccentricity of exoplanets.\n", "authors": "Bertram Bitsch, Willy Kley"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2010-08-16T19:24:42Z", "title": "Thermal Histories of Chondrules in Solar Nebula Shocks", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.2741v1", "summary": "  Chondrules are important early Solar System materials that can provide a\nwealth of information on conditions in the solar nebula, if their formation\nmechanism can be understood.

Contrary to\nthese expectations, we have found that the effect of line cooling is minimal;\nafter the inclusion of line cooling, the cooling rates of chondrules are\n10-1000 K/hr. The reduction in the otherwise rapid cooling rates attributable\nto line cooling is due to a combination of factors, including buffering due to\nhydrogen recombination/dissociation, high column densities of water, and\nbackwarming.

In this paper, we revisit the published HARPS radial velocity\nmeasurements of the object, which were previously used to estimate the\ncompanion mass, but have been the subject of ongoing debate.\n  We build a realistic model of the star's activity during the HARPS\nobservations, by fitting simultaneously the line width and the line bisector,\nand use it to evaluate the contribution of activity to the RV variations. The\ndata show clear evidence of errors above the level of the formal uncertainties,\nwhich are accounted for either by activity, nor by any plausible planet model,\nand which increase rapidly with decreasing signal-to-noise of the spectra. We\ncite evidence of similar systematics in mid-SNR spectra of other targets\nobtained with HARPS and other high-precision RV spectrographs, and discuss\npossible sources. Allowing for these, we re-evaluate the semi-amplitude of the\nCoRoT-7b signal, finding Kb=1.6 +-1.3 m/s, a tentative detection with a much\nreduced significance (1.2-sigma) compared to previous estimates.

The J and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly\ncooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at the\npossibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of\nWASP-12b; the high pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our J and H-band\nobservations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer.\nLastly, our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than\nwould otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material being\ntidally stripped from the planet - as was predicted for this system by Li &\ncollaborators, and for which observational confirmation was recently arguably\nprovided by Fossati & collaborators.\n", "authors": "Bryce Croll, David Lafreniere, Loic Albert, Ray Jayawardhana, Jonathan J.

From\nthis study, we find three properties of the planetary caustic perturbations.\nFirst, planetary systems with the same star-planet separation (s) basically\nproduce perturbations of constant strength regardless of the planet/star mass\nratio (q), but the duration of each perturbation scales with sqrt{q}. Second,\nclose planetary systems with the same separation produce essentially the same\nnegative perturbations between two triangular-shaped caustics regardless of q,\nbut the duration of the perturbations scales with sqrt{q}. Third, the positive\nperturbations for planetary systems with the same mass ratio become stronger as\nthe caustic shrinks with the increasing |log s|, while the negative\nperturbations become weaker. We estimate the degeneracy in the determination of\nq that occurs in planetary caustic events. From this, we find that the mass\nratio can be more precisely determined as q increases and |log s| decreases.

We study the dynamics of warped protoplanetary discs\nunder the combined effects of magnetic warping/precession torques and internal\nstresses in the disc, including viscous damping of warps and propagation of\nbending waves. We show that when the outer disc axis is misaligned with the\nstellar spin axis, the disc evolves towards a warped steady-state on a\ntimescale that depends on the disc viscosity or the bending wave propagation\nspeed, but in all cases is much shorter than the timescale for the spin\nevolution (of order of a million years).

In the gas-free\ncases, rapid planet migration was observed - at a rate independent of the\nplanet's mass - provided the planet's mass was not large compared to the mass\nin planetesimals capable of entering its Hill sphere. In such cases, both\ninward and outward migrations can be self-sustaining, but there is a strong\npropensity for inward migration. When a gas disk is present, aerodynamic drag\ncan substantially modify the dynamics of scattered planetesimals. For\nsufficiently large or small mono-dispersed planetesimals, the planet typically\nmigrates inward. However, for a range of plausible planetesimal sizes (i.e.\n0.5-5.0 km at 5.0 AU in a minimum mass Hayashi disk) outward migration is\nusually triggered, often accompanied by substantial planetary mass accretion.\nThe origins of this behaviour are explained in terms of a toy model. The\neffects of including a size distribution and torques associated with Type-I\nmigration are also discussed.\n", "authors": "Christopher C. Capobianco, Martin Duncan, Harold F.

A 1D radiative-convective\nmodel was used to calculate temperature and pressure profiles of model\natmospheres, assumed to be composed of molecular nitrogen, water, and carbon\ndioxide.

Furthermore, the\ntreatment of the energy transport has been improved in the model to account in\nparticular for high CO2, high-pressure Super-Earth conditions. For four\nhigh-pressure scenarios of our study, the resulting surface temperatures were\nabove 273 K, indicating a potential habitability of the planet. These scenarios\ninclude three CO2-dominated atmospheres (95% CO2 concentration with 5, 10, and\n20 bar surface pressure) and a high-pressure CO2-enriched atmosphere (5% CO2\nconcentration with 20 bar surface pressure).

The trail is made up of\nrelatively large particles of millimetre to centimetre size that remain close\nto the parent asteroid.

This Letter presents results from\nsimulations with a Jupiter-mass planet placed in orbit at 25 AU within a 0.14\n$M_{\\odot}$ disk. The disk spans 5 to 40 AU around a 1 $M_{\\odot}$ star and is\ninitially marginally unstable. In one simulation, the planet is inserted prior\nto the eruption of GIs; in another, it is inserted only after the disk has\nsettled into a quasi-steady GI-active state, where heating by GIs roughly\nbalances radiative cooling. When the planet is present from the beginning, its\nown wake stimulates growth of a particular global mode with which it strongly\ninteracts, and the planet plunges inward six AU in about 10$^3$ years. In both\ncases with embedded planets, there are times when the planet's radial motion is\nslow and varies in direction. At other times, when the planet appears to be\ninteracting with strong spiral modes, migration both inward and outward can be\nrelatively rapid, covering several AUs over hundreds of years.

In particular, we study the\nparticles' probabilities of striking Iapetus, as well as their expected spatial\ndistribution on the Iapetian surface. We find that, of the long-lived particles\n(greater than about 5 microns), most particle sizes (greater than about 10\nmicrons) are virtually certain to strike Iapetus, and their calculated\ndistribution on the surface matches up well with Cassini Regio's extent in its\nlongitudinal span. The satellite's polar regions are observed to be bright,\npresumably because ice is deposited there. Thus, in the latitudinal direction\nwe estimate polar dust deposition rates to help constrain models of thermal\nmigration invoked to explain the bright poles (Spencer & Denk 2010). We also\nanalyze dust originating from other irregular outer moons, determining that a\nsignificant fraction of that material will eventually coat Iapetus--perhaps\nexplaining why the spectrum of Iapetus' dark material differs somewhat from\nthat of Phoebe. Finally we track the dust particles that do not strike Iapetus,\nand find that most land on Titan, with a smaller fraction hitting Hyperion.

However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles.

The\nprimitive meteorite record suggests that sizeable planetesimals formed in the\nasteroid belt over a period longer than a million years, each composed entirely\nof an unusual, but homogeneous, mixture of mm-size particles. We sketch a\nscenario in which primary accretion of 10-100km size planetesimals proceeds\ndirectly, if sporadically, from aerodynamically-sorted mm-size particles\n(generically \"chondrules\"). These planetesimal sizes are in general agreement\nwith the currently observed asteroid mass peak near 100km diameter, which has\nbeen identified as a \"fossil\" property of the pre-erosion, pre-depletion\npopulation. We extend our primary accretion theory to make predictions for\nouter solar system planetesimals, which may also have a preferred size in the\n100km diameter range. We estimate formation rates of planetesimals and assess\nthe conditions needed to match estimates of both asteroid and Kuiper Belt\nObject (KBO) formation rates.

So\nfar, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,\noxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The\ninterpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the\nabsorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar\nradiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we\nintroduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of\nextrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H\nLy alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean\ntemperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H\ndissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which\ncorrespond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model\nthermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the\natmosphere is mostly ionized. We find that the HI transit depth reflects the\noptical depth of the thermosphere in the wings of the H Ly alpha line but that\nthe atmosphere also overflows the Roche lobe. By assuming a solar mixing ratio\nof oxygen, we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with\nthe observations. An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the\nHI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic\nescape, the O/H ratio is supersolar, or if a significant quantity of neutral\noxygen is found outside the Roche lobe. Due to the large uncertainty in the\ndata, repeated observations are necessary to better constrain the OI transit\ndepths and thus the composition of the thermosphere.\n", "authors": "T. T.

The physical nature of the strong photometric variability of T Tau\nSa, the more massive member of the Southern \"infrared companion\" to T Tau, has\nlong been debated. Intrinsic luminosity variations due to variable accretion\nwere originally proposed but later challenged in favor of apparent fluctuations\ndue to time-variable foreground extinction. In this paper we use the timescale\nof the variability as a diagnostic for the underlying physical mechanism.\nBecause the IR emission emerging from Sa is dominantly thermal emission from\ncircumstellar dust at <=1500K, we can derive a minimum size of the region\nresponsible for the time-variable emission. In the context of the variable\nforeground extinction scenario, this region must be (un-) covered within the\nvariability timescale, which implies a minimum velocity for the obscuring\nforeground material. If this velocity supercedes the local Kepler velocity we\ncan reject foreground extinction as a valid variability mechanism. The variable\naccretion scenario allows for shorter variability timescales since the\nvariations in luminosity occur on much smaller scales, essentially at the\nsurface of the star, and the disk surface can react almost instantly on the\nchanging irradiation with a higher or lower dust temperature and according\nbrightness. We have detected substantial variations at long wavelengths in T\nTau S: +26% within four days at 12.8 micron.

This double-rendezvous\nmission is enabled by the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion. Dawn\nwill arrive at Vesta in 2011 and will operate in its vicinity for approximately\none year. Vesta's mass and non-spherical shape, coupled with its rotational\nperiod, presents very interesting challenges to a spacecraft that depends\nprincipally upon low-thrust propulsion for trajectory-changing maneuvers. The\ndetails of Vesta's high-order gravitational terms will not be determined until\nafter Dawn's arrival at Vesta, but it is clear that their effect on Dawn\noperations creates the most complex operational environment for a NASA mission\nto date. Gravitational perturbations give rise to oscillations in Dawn's\norbital radius, and it is found that trapping of the spacecraft is possible\nnear the 1:1 resonance between Dawn's orbital period and Vesta's rotational\nperiod, located approximately between 520 and 580 km orbital radius.This\nresonant trapping can be escaped by thrusting at the appropriate orbital phase.\nHaving passed through the 1:1 resonance, gravitational perturbations ultimately\nlimit the minimum radius for low-altitude operations to about 400 km,in order\nto safely prevent surface impact.

The resulting zodiacal\nlight spectrum is redder than the solar spectrum, and shows a broad absorption\nfeature, previously unreported, at approximately 900 nm, suggesting the\nexistence of silicates in the IPD material. The spectral shape of the zodiacal\nlight is isotropic at all ecliptic latitudes within the measurement error. The\nzodiacal light spectrum, including the extended wavelength range to 2500 nm\nusing IRTS data, is qualitatively similar to the reflectance of S-type\nasteroids.

This\nmodel uses a streamline formalism to calculate the ring's internal forces,\nnamely, ring gravity, pressure, viscosity, as well as a hypothetical drag\nforce. The model calculates the streamlines' forced orbit elements and surface\ndensity throughout the perturbed ring. The model is then applied to the outer\nedge of Saturn's B ring, which is maintained by an m=2 inner LR with the\nsatellite Mimas. Ring models are used to illustrate how a ring's perturbed\nstate depends on the ring's physical properties: surface density, viscosity,\ndispersion velocity, and the hypothetical drag force. A comparison of models to\nthe observed outer B ring suggests that the ring's surface density there is\nbetween 10 and 280 gm/cm^2. The ring's edge also indicates where the viscous\ntorque counterbalances the perturbing satellite's gravitational torque on the\nring. But an examination of seemingly conventional viscous B ring models shows\nthat they all fail to balance these torques at the ring's edge. This is due\nring self-gravity and the fact that a viscous ring tends to be nearly\nperi-aligned with the satellite, which reduces the satellite's torque on the\nring and makes the ring's edge more difficult to maintain. Nonetheless, the\nfollowing shows that a torque balance can still be achieved in a viscous B\nring, but only in an extreme case where the ratio of the ring's bulk/shear\nviscosities satisfy ~10^4. However, if the dissipation of the ring's forced\nmotions is instead dominated by a weak drag force, then the satellite can exert\na much stronger torque that can counterbalance the ring's viscous torque.\n", "authors": "Joseph M.

One of the major theoretical\nproblems occurs in the intermediate stage-planetesimals accretion into\nplanetary embryos-during which the companion's perturbations can stir up the\nrelative velocites(dV) of planetesimals and thus slow down or even cease their\ngrowth. However, all previous studies assumed a 2-dimentional (2D) disk and a\ncoplanar binary orbit. Extending previous studies by including a 3D gas disk\nand an inclined binary orbit with small relative inclination of i_B=0.1-5 deg,\nwe numerically investigate the conditions for planetesimal accretion at 1-2 AU,\nan extension of the habitable zone(1-1.3 AU), around alpha Centauri A in this\npaper. Inclusion of the binary inclination leads to: (1) differential orbital\nphasing is realized in the 3D space, and thus different-sized bodies are\nseparated from each other; (2) total impact rate becomes lower, and impacts\nmainly occur between similar-sized bodies; (3) accretion is more favored, but\nthe balance between accretion and erosion remains uncertain, and the \"possible\naccretion region\" extends up to 2AU when assuming an optimistic Q*(critical\nspecific energy that leads to catastrophic fragmentation); and (4) impact\nvelocities (dV) are significantly reduced but still much larger than their\nescape velocities, which infers that planetesimals grow by means of type II\nrunaway mode. As a conclusion, inclusion of a small binary inclination is a\npromising mechanism that favors accretion, opening a possibility that planet\nformation in close binary systems can go through the difficult stage of\nplanetesimals accretion into planetary embryos.\n", "authors": "Ji-Wei Xie, Ji-Lin Zhou"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2009-04-07T13:15:32Z", "title": "A break in the gas and dust surface density of the disc around the T\n  Tauri star IM Lup", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1127v1", "summary": "  We study the distribution and physical properties of molecular gas in the\ndisc around the T Tauri star IM Lup on scales close to 200 AU.

The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a\nsystem such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are\nseparated by a great distance.

Specifically, we show that the current ephemeris of\nPluto does not preclude the existence of the Pioneer effect. We show that the\norbit of Pluto is simply not well enough characterized at present to make such\nan assertion. A number of misunderstandings related to these topics have now\npropagated through the literature and have been used as a basis for drawing\nconclusions about the dynamics of the solar system.

We consider here a similar\nproblem taking into account a gas giant with masses in the range of 0.5 to 1\nJupiter mass and a Super-Earth as the outermost planet. By changing disc\nparameters and planet masses we have succeeded in getting the convergent\nmigration which allows for the possibility of their resonant locking. However,\nin the case in which the gas giant has the mass of Jupiter, before any mean\nmotion first order commensurability could be achieved, the Super-Earth is\ncaught in a trap when it is very close to the edge of the gap opened by the\ngiant planet. This confirms the result obtained by Pierens & Nelson (2008) in\ntheir simulations. Additionally, we have found that, in a very thin disc, an\napsidal resonance is observed in the system if the Super-Earth is captured in\nthe trap. Moreover, the eccentricity of the small planet remains low, while\nthat of the gas giant increases slightly due to the imbalance between Lindblad\nand corotational resonances.

In this case, after\nperforming an extensive survey over all possible parameters, we have succeeded\nin getting the 1:2 mean motion resonant configuration only in a disc with low\naspect ratio and low surface density. However, the resonance is maintained just\nfor few thousand orbits.

If CoRoT-7 b has always been a rocky body, evaporation\nmay have driven off almost half its original mass, but the mass loss may depend\nsensitively on the extent of tidal decay of its orbit. As tides caused CoRoT-7\nb's orbit to decay, they brought the planet closer to its host star, thereby\nenhancing the mass loss rate.

Mass of the Oort cloud of comets is less than 1 mass of the Earth\n($M_{E}$), probably not greater than 1/2 $M_{E}$.\n  2. Theoretical number of long-period comets with perihelion distance $q$ $<$\n5 AU is about 50-times greater than the conventional approach yields. Gravity\nof Jupiter was taken into account in finding this result.\n  3. Semi-major axis $a$ and period of oscillations $P$ of eccentricity (and\nother orbital elements) are related as $a^{3}$ $P$ $=$ 1 in natural units for a\nmoving Solar System in the Galaxy. The natural unit for time is the orbital\nperiod of the Solar System revolution around the galactic center and the\nnatural unit for measuring the semi-major axis is its maximum value for the\nhalf-radius of the Solar System corresponding to the half-radius of the Oort\ncloud. The relation holds for the cases when comets approach the inner part of\nthe Solar System, e.g., perihelion distances are less than $\\approx$ 100 AU.\n  4. The minimum value of semi-major axis for the Oort cloud is $a_{min}$ $\\ll$\n1 $\\times$ 10$^{4}$ AU.

In contrast, an important fraction of Near Earth Asteroids\n(NEAs), defined as Q-types in the asteroid taxonomy, display spectral\nattributes that are a good match to OCs. Here we study the possibility that the\nQ-type NEAs underwent recent encounters with the terrestrial planets and that\nthe tidal gravity (or other effects) during these encounters exposed fresh OC\nmaterial on the surface (thus giving it the Q-type spectral properties). We\nused numerical integrations to determine the statistics of encounters of NEAs\nto planets. The results were used to calculate the fraction and orbital\ndistribution of Q-type asteroids expected in the model as a function of the\nspace weathering timescale, t_sw (see main text for definition), and maximum\ndistance, r*, at which planetary encounters can reset the surface.

These motions appear to be a\nstellar response to nonlinear interactions between discrete global spiral modes\nin both the burst and asymptotic phases of the evolution, and the star's\norbital motion about the COM reflects the orbit periods of disk material near\nthe corotation radii of the dominant spiral waves. This motion is, in\nprinciple, large enough to be observable and could be confused with stellar\nwobble due to the presence of one or more super-Jupiter mass protoplanets\norbiting at 10's AU.

Supernova shock waves appear to be\nthin enough to inject the amount of shock wave material necessary to match the\nshort-lived radioisotope abundances measured for primitive meteorites.\nPlanetary nebula shock waves from AGB stars, however, appear to be too thick to\nachieve the required injection efficiencies. These models imply that a\nsupernova pulled the trigger that led to the formation of our solar system.\n", "authors": "Alan P. Boss, Sandra A.

We show that higher metallicity results in\nslower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the\npre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects\nof opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same\nthree planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.\nWhen these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be\nof order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time\nscale calculated without these effects.

With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel.

For the triple star case, we find that the brightness\ndifference between a primary and an eclipsing secondary is about 9-10 mag in\nthe visual but only about 4.5-5.9 magnitudes in the K-band. We demonstrate how\nthe triple star hypothesis can be excluded by taking a high-resolution IR\nspectrum. Simulations of these systems show that the companions can be detected\nwith a false-alarm probability of 2%, if the spectrum has a S/N-ratio > 100. We\nshow that high-resolution IR spectra also allows to detect most of the false\npositives caused by foreground or background binaries. If high resolution IR\nspectroscopy is combined with photometric methods, virtually all false\npositives can be detected without RV measurements. It is thus possible to\nconfirm transiting terrestrial planets with a modest investment of observing\ntime.\n", "authors": "Eike W.

HARPS can now reach a\nprecision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes of\ndifferent stellar perturbations, such as oscillation, granulation, and\nactivity. Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise\nof a few meter-per-second. The aim of this paper is to simulate this activity\nand calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies.\nBased on Sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the\nsurface of a rotating star. We then calculate the radial-velocity effect\ninduced by these spot groups as a function of time. Taking into account\noscillation, granulation, activity, and a HARPS instrumental error of 80 cm/s,\nwe simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to\nefficiently reduce all sources of noise. Applying three measurements per night\nof 10 minutes every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best tested\nstrategy. Depending on the level of activity considered, from log(R'_HK)= -5 to\n-4.75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2.5 to 3.5 Earth masses\nin the habitable zone of a K1V dwarf. Using Bern's model of planetary\nformation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35 % of\nthe planets between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200\ndays should be found with HARPS. A comparison between the performance of HARPS\nand ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations. Using the same optimized\nstrategy, ESPRESSO could find 1.3 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of\nearly-K dwarfs.

As the conventional constraints for extrasolar planets\nlike mass, radius, and temperature allow for a large number of acceptable\nmodels, a new planetary parameter is desirable in order to further constrain\nplanetary models. Such a parameter may be the tidal Love number k2. In this\npaper we aim to study the capability of k2 to reveal further information about\nthe interior structure of a planet. With theoretical planetary models we\ninvestigate how the tidal Love number k2 responds to the internal density\ndistribution of a planet. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of the\ndegeneracy of k2 due to a density discontinuity in the envelope of a\nthree-layer planetary model. The effect of a possible outer density\ndiscontinuity masks the effect of the core mass on the Love number k2. Hence,\nthere is no unique relationship between the Love number k2 and the core mass of\na planet. We show that the degeneracy of k2 with respect to a layer boundary in\nthe envelope also occurs in existing planets, e.g. Saturn and the Hot Neptune\nGJ436b.

Besides radiative and tidal forces the\npresence of dense gas aggregates in star-forming regions are potential sources\nfor perturbations to protoplanetary discs or systems. Here we show that\nsubsequent capture of gas from large extended accretion envelopes onto a\npassing star with a typical circumstellar disc can tilt the disc plane to\nretrograde orientation, naturally explaining the formation of strongly inclined\nplanetary systems. Furthermore, the inner disc regions may become denser, and\nthus more prone to speedy coagulation and planet formation. Pre-existing\nplanetary systems are compressed by gas inflows leading to a natural occurrence\nof close-in misaligned hot Jupiters and short-period eccentric planets. The\nlikelihood of such events mainly depends on the gas content of the cluster and\nis thus expected to be highest in the youngest star clusters.\n", "authors": "Ingo Thies, Pavel Kroupa, Simon P.

Due to gas-drag, collisional damping, and\nresonant shepherding, the planetary embryos repel the planetesimals away from\ntheir reach and thus they stop growing (Levison et al. 2010). This problem\npersists independently of whether the accretion took place at the current\nlocations of the ice giants or closer to the Sun. Instead of trying to push the\nrunaway/oligarchic growth of planetary embryos up to 10-15 Earth masses, we\nenvision the possibility that the planetesimal disk could generate a system of\nplanetary embryos of only 1-3 Earth masses. Then we investigate whether these\nembryos could have collided with each other and grown enough to reach the\nmasses of current Uranus and Neptune. Our results point to two major problems.\nFirst, there is typically a large difference in mass between the first and the\nsecond most massive core formed and retained beyond Saturn. Second, in many\nsimulations the final planetary system has more than two objects beyond Saturn.\nThe growth of a major planet from a system of embryos requires strong damping\nof eccentricities and inclinations from the disk of gas. But strong damping\nalso favors embryos and cores to find a stable resonant configuration, so that\nsystems with more than two surviving objects are found. In addition to these\nproblems, in order to have substantial mutual accretion among embryos, it is\nnecessary to assume that the surface density of the gas was several times\nhigher than that of the minimum-mass solar nebula. However this contrasts with\nthe common idea that Uranus and Neptune formed in a gas-starving disk, which is\nsuggested by the relatively small amount of hydrogen and helium contained in\nthe atmospheres of these planets.

The presence of tiny grains in PPDs thus raises the\nquestion of whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is able to drive\nrapid accretion to be consistent with observations. Charged tiny grains have\nsimilar conduction properties as ions, whose presence leads to qualitatively\nnew behaviors in the conductivity tensor, characterized by n_bar/n_e>1, where\nn_e and n_bar denote the number densities of free electrons and all other\ncharged species respectively. In particular, Ohmic conductivity becomes\ndominated by charged grains rather than electrons when n_bar/n_e exceeds about\n10^3, and Hall and ambipolar diffusion (AD) coefficients are reduced by a\nfactor of (n_bar/n_e)^2 in the AD dominated regime relative to that in the\nOhmic regime.

However, the width of\nmean motion resonances grows with the particles' eccentricity, which will\nincrease the width of the chaotic zone at higher eccentricities. Here we\ninvestigate the width of the chaotic zone using the iterated encounter map and\nN-body integrations. We find that the classical prescription works well for\nparticles on low-eccentricity orbits.

We present a new numerical model, to\nstudy the spatial structure of perturbed debris discs at dynamical and\ncollisional steady-state. We focus on the competing effects between\ngravitational perturbations by a massive body (planet or star), collisional\nproduction of small grains, and radiation pressure placing these grains in\npossibly dynamically unstable regions. We consider a disc of parent bodies at\ndynamical steady-state, from which small radiation-pressure-affected grains are\nreleased in a series of runs, each corresponding to a different orbital\nposition of the perturber, where particles are assigned a collisional\ndestruction probability. These collisional runs produce successive position\nmaps that are then recombined, following a complex procedure, to produce\nsurface density profiles for each orbital position of the perturbing body.

If Jupiter and Saturn migrated with eccentricities comparable to their\npresent day values, smooth migration with exponential timescales characteristic\nof planetesimal-driven migration (\\tau~5-10 Myr) would have perturbed the\neccentricities of the terrestrial planets to values greatly exceeding the\nobserved ones. This excitation may be mitigated if the eccentricity of Jupiter\nwas small during the migration epoch, migration was very rapid (e.g. \\tau<~ 0.5\nMyr perhaps via planet-planet scattering or instability-driven migration) or\nthe observed small eccentricity amplitudes of the j=2,3 terrestrial modes\nresult from low probability cancellation of several large amplitude\ncontributions. Further, results of orbital integrations show that very short\nmigration timescales (\\tau<0.5 Myr), characteristic of instability-driven\nmigration, may also perturb the terrestrial planets' eccentricities by amounts\ncomparable to their observed values. We discuss the implications of these\nconstraints for the relative timing of terrestrial planet formation, giant\nplanet migration, and the origin of the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment of the\nMoon 3.9+/-0.1 Ga ago. We suggest that the simplest way to satisfy these\ndynamical constraints may be for the bulk of any giant planet migration to be\ncomplete in the first 30-100 Myr of solar system history.\n", "authors": "Craig B.

First, the system consisting of stars, planets and\ncomets is treated self-consistently in our N-body simulations, rather than\napproximating the stellar encounters with the outer Solar System as hyperbolic\nfly-bys. Second, we have included the expulsion of the cluster gas, a feature\nthat was absent previously. Third, we have used several models for the initial\nconditions and density profile of the cluster -- either a Hernquist or Plummer\npotential -- and chose other parameters based on the latest observations of\nembedded clusters from the literature. {These other parameters result in the\nstars being on radial orbits and the cluster collapses.} Similar to previous\nstudies, in our simulations the inner Oort cloud is formed from comets being\nscattered by Jupiter and Saturn and having their pericentres decoupled from the\nplanets by perturbations from the cluster gas and other stars. We find that all\ninner Oort clouds formed in these clusters have an inner edge ranging from 100\nAU to a few hundred AU, and an outer edge at over 100\\,000 AU, with little\nvariation in these values for all clusters. All inner Oort clouds formed are\nconsistent with the existence of (90377) Sedna, an inner Oort cloud dwarf\nplanetoid, at the inner edge of the cloud: Sedna tends to be at the innermost\n2% for Plummer models, while it is 5% for Hernquist models.

In a recent paper (Bonfils et al.\n2011), we announced the discovery of respectively 1 and 2 low mass planets\naround the M1.5V stars Gl433 and Gl667C.

We have obtained additional HARPS observations of those two stars,\nfor a total of respectively 67 and 179 Radial Velocity measurements for Gl433\nand Gl667C, and present here an orbital analysis of those extended data sets\nand our main conclusion about both planetary systems. One of the three planets,\nGl667Cc, has a mass of only M2.sin(i)~4.25 M_earth and orbits in the central\nhabitable zone of its host star. It receives just 10% less stellar energy from\nGl667C than the Earth receives from the Sun. However planet evolution in\nhabitable zone can be very different if the host star is a M dwarf or a\nsolar-like star, without necessarily questioning the presence of water. The two\nother planets, Gl433b and Gl667Cb, both have M2.sin(i) of ~5.5 M_earth and\nperiods of ~7 days. The Radial Velocity measurements of both stars contain\nlonger time scale signals, which we fit as longer period Keplerians. For Gl433\nthat signal probably originates in a Magnetic Cycle, while a longer time span\nwill be needed to conclude for Gl667C. The metallicity of Gl433 is close to\nsolar, while Gl667C is metal poor with [Fe/H] ~ -0.6.

Based on the SED shape and the assumption that\nit was produced by a single star and its disk, CoKu Tau/4 was classified as a\nprototypical transitional disk, with a clean inner hole possibly carved out by\na planet, some other orbiting body, or by photodissociation. However, recently\nit has been discovered that CoKu Tau/4 is a close binary system. This implies\nthat the observed mid-IR SED is probably produced by the circumbinary disk. The\naim of the present paper is to model the SED of CoKu Tau/4 as arising from the\ninner wall of a circumbinary disk, with parameters constrained by what is known\nabout the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction between\nthese stars and their surrounding disk. In order to fit the Spitzer IRS SED,\nthe binary orbit should be almost circular, implying a small mid-IR variability\n(10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of the\ncircumbinary disk. Our models suggest that the inner wall of CoKu Tau/4 is\nlocated at 1.7a, where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8AU). A\nsmall amount of optically thin dust in the hole (<0.01 lunar masses) helps to\nimprove the fit to the 10microns silicate band.

Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular\nobserved value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a\ndistribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e. the presumptive\nprior distribution . Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn\ndepends on the intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being\nstudied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it\nto several \"toy models\" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of\nM_T. The results show that the effect can be an important one.

The final configurations and\ncollisional histories strongly depend on the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter.\nIf today's eccentricity of Jupiter is used, then most of bodies in the\nasteroidal region are swept up within the terrestrial region owing to the\ninward migration of the secular resonance, and giant impacts between\nprotoplanets occur most commonly around 10 Myr. If the orbital eccentricity of\nJupiter is close to zero, as suggested in the Nice model, the effect of the\nsecular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a long\nperiod of time in the asteroidal region. With a circular orbit for Jupiter,\ngiant impacts usually occur around 100 Myr, consistent with the accretion time\nscale indicated from isotope records. However, we inevitably have an Earth size\nplanet at around 2 AU in this case. It is very difficult to obtain spatially\nconcentrated terrestrial planets together with very late giant impacts.\n", "authors": "Ryuji Morishima, Joachim Stadel, Ben Moore"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2010-07-04T21:43:17Z", "title": "New Parameters and Transit Timing Studies for OGLE2-TR-L9 b", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0589v1", "summary": "  Context: Repeated observations of exoplanet transits allow us to refine the\nplanetary parameters and probe them for any time dependent variations.

One may wonder if the\nmid-sized moons may have formed also from the debris of a massive ring\nprogenitor, as also suggested in Canup (2010). However, the process driving\nmid-sized moons accretion from the icy debris disks has not been investigated\nin details.

Using a hybrid computer model, we show that accretion\nwithin massive icy rings can form all mid-sized moons from Mimas to Rhea.\nHowever in order to explain their current locations, intense dissipation within\nSaturn (with Qp<2000) would be required.

For such\nsmall particles, the strongest turbulence is expected to occur when the\ndust-to-gas ratio of the disk is ~C_eff^(1/2) (h_g / r) ~ 10^(-2), where C_eff\n~ 0.2 represents the energy supply efficiency to turbulence and h_g / r ~ 5 x\n10^(-2) is the aspect ratio of the gas disk. The maximum viscosity parameter is\nalpha_max ~ C_eff T_s (h_g / r)^2 ~ 10^(-4) T_s, where T_s (<1) is the\nnon-dimensional stopping time of the dust particles. Modification in the\ndust-to-gas ratio from the standard value, 10^(-2), by any process, results in\nweaker turbulence and a thinner dust layer, and consequently may accelerate the\ngrowth process of the dust particles.\n", "authors": "Taku Takeuchi, Takayuki Muto, Satoshi Okuzumi, Naoki Ishitsu, Shigeru Ida"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2011-09-22T13:36:33Z", "title": "A Shorter 146Sm Half-Life Measured and Implications for 146Sm-142Nd\n  Chronology in the Solar System", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4805v3", "summary": "  The extinct p-process nuclide 146Sm serves as an astrophysical and\ngeochemical chronometer through measurements of isotopic anomalies of its\nalpha-decay daughter 142Nd.

Basin\nmagnetization signatures and lunar crater size-distributions indicate that the\nlast episode of bombardment at about 3.85 Gyr ago was less extensive than\npreviously thought. We explore the contribution of the primordial Mars-crosser\npopulation to early lunar bombardment. We find that Mars-crosser population\ninitially decays with a 80-Myr half-life, with the long tail of survivors\nclustering on temporarily non-Mars-crossing orbits between 1.8 and 2 AU. These\nsurvivors decay with half-life of about 600 Myr and are progenitors of the\nextant Hungaria asteroid group in the same region. We estimate the primordial\nMars-crosser population contained about 0.01-0.02 Earth masses. Such initial\npopulation is consistent with no lunar basins forming after 3.8 Gya and the\namount of mass in the Hungaria group. As they survive longer and in greater\nnumbers than other primordial populations, Mars-crossers are the best candidate\nfor forming the majority of lunar craters and basins, including most of the\nNectarian system. However, this remnant population cannot produce Imbrium and\nOrientale basins, which formed too late and are too large to be part of a\nsmooth bombardment. We propose that the Imbrian basins and craters formed in a\ndiscrete event, consistent with the basin magnetization signatures and crater\nsize-distributions. This late \"impactor shower\" would be triggered by a\ncollisional disruption of a Vesta-sized body from this primordial Mars-crossing\npopulation (Wetherill, 1975) that was still comparable to the present-day\nasteroid belt a 3.9 Gya. This tidal disruption lead to a short-lived spike in\nbombardment by non-chondritic impactors with a non-asteroidal size-frequency\ndistribution, in agreement with available evidence.

We have done three-band photometric\nobservations with Herschel/PACS and we use a consistent method for data\nreduction and aperture photometry of this sample to obtain monochromatic flux\ndensities at 70.0, 100.0 and 160.0 \\mu m. Additionally, we use Spitzer/MIPS\nflux densities at 23.68 and 71.42 \\mu m when available, and we present new\nSpitzer flux densities of eight targets. We derive diameters and albedos with\nthe near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM). As auxiliary data we use\nreexamined absolute visual magnitudes from the literature and data bases, part\nof which have been obtained by ground based programs in support of our Herschel\nkey program. We have determined for the first time radiometric sizes and\nalbedos of eight classical TNOs, and refined previous size and albedo estimates\nor limits of 11 other classicals. The new size estimates of 2002 MS4 and 120347\nSalacia indicate that they are among the 10 largest TNOs known. Our new results\nconfirm the recent findings that there are very diverse albedos among the\nclassical TNOs and that cold classicals possess a high average albedo (0.17 +/-\n0.04). Diameters of classical TNOs strongly correlate with orbital inclination\nin our sample. We also determine the bulk densities of six binary TNOs.\n", "authors": "E. Vilenius, C. Kiss, M. Mommert, T.

We calculate the trajectories of chondrules flowing\npast the body, and find that they are not accreted by the protoplanet, but may\ninstead flow through volatiles outgassed from the planet's magma ocean. In\ncontrast, chondrules are accreted onto smaller planetesimals. We calculate the\nthermal histories of chondrules passing through the bow shock. We find that\npeak temperatures and cooling rates are consistent with the formation of the\ndominant, porphyritic texture of most chondrules, assuming a modest enhancement\nabove the likely solar nebula average value of chondrule densities (by a factor\nof 10), attributable to settling of chondrule precursors to the midplane of the\ndisk or turbulent concentration.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either\nthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies\nvorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive\ntransition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI.

Although our mission design was completed as\npart of an academic exercise, this study serves as a useful starting point for\nfuture Trojan mission design studies. In particular, we identify and discuss\nkey issues that can make large differences in the complex trade-offs required\nwhen designing a mission to the Trojan asteroids.\n", "authors": "Serina Diniega, Kunio M.

Very important parameters\ndetermining the structure of disks, and hence the direction of migration, are\nthe viscosity and the adiabatic index. In this paper we investigate the\ninfluence of different viscosity prescriptions (alpha-type and constant) and\nadiabatic indices on disk structures and how this affects the migration rate of\nplanets embedded in such disks. We perform 3D numerical simulations of\naccretion disks with embedded planets. We use the explicit/implicit\nhydrodynamical code NIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and radiation\ntransport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation, as well as a proper\nequation of state for molecular hydrogen. The migration of embedded 20Earthmass\nplanets is studied. Low-viscosity disks have cooler temperatures and the\nmigration rates of embedded planets tend toward the isothermal limit. In these\ndisks, planets migrate inwards even in the fully radiative case. The effect of\noutward migration can only be sustained if the viscosity in the disk is large.\nOverall, the differences between the treatments for the equation of state seem\nto play a more important role in disks with higher viscosity. A change in the\nadiabatic index and in the viscosity changes the zero-torque radius that\nseparates inward from outward migration. For larger viscosities, temperatures\nin the disk become higher and the zero-torque radius moves to larger radii,\nallowing outward migration of a 20 Earth-mass planet to persist over an\nextended radial range.

In theory, torque exchange between these moons and\nring particles leads to radial drift. We predict that moons with Hill radii r_H\n~ 2-24 km should migrate through the A ring in 1000 yr. In this size range,\nmoons orbiting in an empty gap or in a full ring eventually migrate at the same\nrate. Smaller moons or moonlets -- such as the propellers (e.g., Tiscareno et\nal. 2006) -- are trapped by diffusion of disk material into corotating orbits,\ncreating inertial drag. Larger moons -- such as Pan or Atlas -- do not migrate\nbecause of their own inertia. Fast migration of 2-24 km moons should eliminate\nintermediate-size bodies from the A ring and may be responsible for the\nobserved large-radius cutoff of r_H ~ 1-2 km in the size distribution of the A\nring's propeller moonlets. Although the presence of Daphnis (r_H ~ 5 km) inside\nthe Keeler gap challenges this scenario, numerical simulations demonstrate that\norbital resonances and stirring by distant, larger moons (e.g., Mimas) may be\nimportant factors. For Daphnis, stirring by distant moons seems the most\npromising mechanism to halt fast migration.

The properties of binary lightcurves are largely\nconsistent with the greater population except in the case of tidally locked\nsystems. All the Haumea family objects measured so far have measurable\namplitudes and rotation periods le 10 hr suggesting that they are not\nsignificantly different from the larger TNO population. We expect multiple\nfactors are influencing object rotations: object size dominates lightcurve\nproperties except in the case of tidal, or proportionally large collisional\ninteractions with other objects, the influence of the latter being different\nfor each sub-population.

In this paper, we\nexplore the important influences on hot-Jupiter radius evolution of (i)\nadditional heat sources in the high atmosphere, the deep atmosphere, and deep\nin the convective interior; (ii) consistent cooling of the deep interior\nthrough the planetary dayside, nightside, and poles; (iii) the degree of heat\nredistribution to the nightside; and (iv) the presence of an upper atmosphere\nabsorber inferred to produce anomalously hot upper atmospheres and inversions\nin some close-in giant planets. In particular, we compare the radius expansion\neffects of atmospheric and deep-interior heating at the same power levels and\nderive the power required to achieve a given radius increase when night-side\ncooling is incorporated. We find that models that include consistent day/night\ncooling are more similar to isotropically irradiated models when there is more\nheat redistributed from the dayside to the nightside. In addition, we consider\nthe efficacy of ohmic heating in the atmosphere and/or convective interior in\ninflating hot Jupiters. Among our conclusions are that (i) the most highly\nirradiated planets cannot stably have uB > (10 km/s Gauss) over a large\nfraction of their daysides, where u is the zonal wind speed and B is the\ndipolar magnetic field strength in the atmosphere, and (ii) that ohmic heating\ncannot in and of itself lead to a runaway in planet radius.\n", "authors": "David S.

The group forms a cluster within the region where the most stable\nTrojans should reside. Based on a combinatorial analysis and a comparison with\nthe Jovian Trojan population, we argue that both this feature and the apparent\npaucity of km-sized Martian Trojans (Trilling et al, 2006) as compared to\nexpectations from earlier work (Tabachnik and Evans, 1999) is not due to\nobservational bias but instead a natural end result of the collisional\ncomminution (Jutzi et al, 2010) or, alternatively, the rotational fission\n(Pravec et al, 2010) of a progenitor L5 Trojan of Mars. Under the collisional\nscenario in particular, the new Martian Trojans are dynamically young, in\nagreement with our age estimate of this \"cluster\" of < 2 Gyr based on the\nearlier work of Scholl et al.

The new habitable zone boundaries increase the number of planet\ncandidates in the habitable zone.

We find, concurring with the analytical understandings developed in\nLithwick (2014), as well as previous numerical studies, that a size spectrum\n$dn/dR \\propto R^{-4}$ results, and that the formation efficiency, defined as\nmass fraction in bodies much larger than the initial size, is $\\sim {\\mathrm{ a\n\\,\\, few}}\\times R_\\odot/a$, or $\\sim 10^{-3}$ at the distance of the Kuiper\nbelt. We argue that this extreme inefficiency invalidates the conventional\nconglomeration model for the formation of both our Kuiper belt and extra-solar\ndebris disks. New theories, possibly involving direct gravitational collapse,\nor strong collisional cooling of small planetesimals, are required.\n", "authors": "Andrew Shannon, Yanqin Wu, Yoram Lithwick"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2013-03-15T20:00:24Z", "title": "After Runaway: The Trans-Hill Stage of Planetesimal Growth", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3890v1", "summary": "  When planetesimals begin to grow by coagulation, they enter an epoch of\nrunaway, during which the biggest bodies grow faster than all the others. The\nquestions of how runaway ends and what comes next have not been answered\nsatisfactorily. Here we show that runaway is followed by a `trans-hill stage'\nthat commences once the bodies become trans-hill, i.e. once the Hill velocity\nof the bodies that dominate viscous stirring matches the random speed of the\nsmall bodies they accrete. Subsequently, the small bodies' speed grows in\nlockstep with the big bodies' sizes, such that the bodies remain in the\ntrans-hill state. Trans-hill growth is crucial for determining the efficiency\nof growing big bodies, as well as their growth timescale and size spectrum.\n  We work out the properties of trans-hill growth analytically and confirm\nthese numerically. Trans-hill growth has two sub-stages. In the earlier one,\ncollisional cooling is irrelevant, in which case the efficiency of forming big\nbodies remains very low (0.1% in the Kuiper belt) and their mass spectrum is\nflat. This explains results from previous coagulation simulations for both the\nKuiper belt and the asteroid belt. The second sub-stage commences when small\nbodies begin to collide with one another. Collisional cooling then controls the\nevolution, in which case the efficiency of forming big bodies rises, and their\nsize spectrum becomes more top-heavy.\n  Trans-hill growth terminates in one of two ways, depending on parameters.\nFirst, mutual accretion of big bodies can become significant and conglomeration\nproceeds until half the total mass is converted into big bodies. This mode of\ngrowth may explain the size distributions of minor bodies in the Solar System,\nand is explored in forthcoming work. Second, if big bodies become separated by\ntheir Hill radius, oligarchy commences. This mode likely precedes the formation\nof fully-fledged planets.\n", "authors": "Yoram Lithwick"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2013-03-15T20:24:06Z", "title": "Kepler planets: a tale of evaporation", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3899v3", "summary": "  (Abridged) Inspired by the Kepler planet discoveries, we consider the thermal\ncontraction of planets close to their parent star, under the influence of\nevaporation.

To test\ntheir stability, the planetary systems were followed with SyMBA for up to\n$10^8$ yr after the gas disk dispersal.\n  We find that dynamics of the growing planets is complex, because migration\nand resonances raise their orbital eccentricities, and cause dynamical\ninstabilities when gas is still around. If the dynamical instabilities occur\nearly, planets can be removed by collisions and ejections, and the system\nrearranges into a new, more stable configuration. In this case, the planetary\nsystems emerging from the gas disks are expected to be stable, and would need\nto be destabilized by other means (low-mass planets, planetesimal disks, etc.).\nAlternatively, for the giant planet system to be intrinsically unstable upon\nthe gas disk dispersal, a special timing would be required with the growth of\n(at least some of) the giant planets having to occur near the end of the gas\ndisk lifetime.\n", "authors": "Elena Lega, Alessandro Morbidelli, David Nesvorn\u00fd"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2013-03-26T20:03:34Z", "title": "S-Type and P-Type Habitability in Stellar Binary Systems: A\n  Comprehensive Approach.

For this purpose, we employ the 2D\nself-gravitating shearing sheet approximation. A simple cooling law with a\nconstant cooling time is adopted, such that the disc settles down into a\nquasi-steady gravitoturbulent state. In this state, vortices appear as\ntransient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation, growth to sizes\ncomparable to a local Jeans scale and eventual shearing and destruction due to\nthe combined effects of self-gravity and background Keplerian shear. Each phase\ntypically lasts about 2 orbital periods or less. As a result, in\nself-gravitating discs the overall dynamical picture of vortex evolution is\nirregular consisting of many transient vortices at different evolutionary\nstages and, therefore, with various sizes up to the local Jeans scale. Vortices\ngenerate density waves during evolution, which turn into shocks.

This paper presents a\ncomparison of a number of H2O line lists that have been, or that could\npotentially be used, to analyze Venus deep atmosphere water abundances and\nshows that there are substantial discrepancies between them. For example, the\nearly high-temperature list used by Meadows and Crisp (1996) had large\nsystematic errors in line intensities. When these are corrected for using the\nmore recent high-temperature BT2 list of Barber et al. (2006) their value of\n45+/-10 ppm for the water vapor mixing ratio reduces to 27+/-6 ppm. The HITRAN\nand GEISA lists used for most other studies of Venus are deficient in \"hot\"\nlines that become important in the Venus deep atmosphere and also show evidence\nof systematic errors in line intensities, particularly for the 8000 to 9500\ncm-1 region that includes the 1.18 um window. Water vapor mixing ratios derived\nfrom these lists may also be somewhat overestimated. The BT2 line list is\nrecommended as being the most complete and accurate current representation of\nthe H2O spectrum at Venus temperatures.\n", "authors": "Jeremy Bailey"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2009-01-25T05:35:19Z", "title": "A Shocking Solar Nebula?", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3875v1", "summary": "  It has been suggested that shock waves in the solar nebula formed the high\ntemperature materials observed in meteorites and comets.

We consider\nparticle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few\nmillimeters.We use a grid--based MHD code to perform global two-fluid\nsimulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of\nvarious sizes. In quasi--steady state, the gravitational settling of dust\nparticles is balanced by turbulent diffusion. Simple and standard models of\nthis process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust\ndensity. The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns\nin size), especially in the disc upper layers ($Z>3H$, where $H$ is the\nscale-height). Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement\nbetween the simple model predictions and the simulation results. This is\nbecause MHD turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs, since velocity\nfluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly\nmagnetized corona develops. We provide an alternative model that gives a better\nfit to the simulations. In this model, dust particles are diffused away from\nthe midplane by MHD turbulence, but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically\nand is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical\nvelocity fluctuations. The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used\nto trace the properties of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs, such as the\namplitude of the velocity fluctuations.

A subsurface ocean frictionally decouples the shell\nfrom the interior. This has led to proposals that a weak tidal or atmospheric\ntorque might cause the shell to rotate differentially with respect to the\nsynchronously rotating interior. As a result of centrifugal and tidal forces,\nthe ocean would assume an ellipsoidal shape with its long axis aligned toward\nthe parent planet. Any displacement of the shell away from its equilibrium\nposition would induce strains thereby increasing its elastic energy and giving\nrise to an elastic restoring torque. We compare the elastic torque with the\ntidal torque acting on Europa and the atmospheric torque acting on Titan. For\nEuropa, the tidal torque is far too weak to produce stresses that could\nfracture the ice shell, thus refuting a widely advocated idea. Instead, we\nsuggest that cracks arise from time-dependent stresses due to non-hydrostatic\ngravity anomalies from tidally driven, episodic convection in the interior. Two\nyears of Cassini RADAR observations of Titan's surface are interpreted as\nimplying an angular displacement of ~0.24 degrees relative to synchroneity.\nCompatibility of the amplitude and phase of the observed non-synchronous\nrotation with estimates of the atmospheric torque requires that Titan's shell\nbe decoupled from its interior. We find that the elastic torque balances the\natmospheric torque at an angular displacement <0.05 degrees, thus coupling the\nshell to the interior. Moreover, if Titan's surface were spinning faster than\nsynchronous, the tidal torque tending to restore synchronous rotation would\ncertainly be larger than the atmospheric torque.

In this paper, we explore the effects of emission from the\nnightside of the exoplanet on the primary transit lightcurve, which is\nessentially a self-blend. Allowing for nightside emission, an exoplanet's\ntransit depth is no longer exclusively a function of the ratio-of-radii.

We use a grid-based\nhydrodynamics code to perform 2D simulations of a system consisting of a giant\nplanet embedded within a gaseous disc orbiting around a star, which is\nperturbed by a passing star on a prograde, parabolic orbit. The disc model\nextends out to 50 AU, and parabolic encounters are considered with impact\nparameters ranging from 100 - 250 AU. In agreement with previous work, we find\nthat the disc is significantly tidally truncated for encounters < 150 AU, and\nthe removal of angular momentum from the disc by the passing star causes a\nsubstantial inflow of gas through the disc. The gap formed by the embedded\nplanet becomes flooded with gas, causing the gas accretion rate onto the planet\nto increase abruptly. Gas flow through the gap, and into the inner disc, causes\nthe positive inner disc torques exerted on the planet to increase, resulting in\na sustained period of outward migration.

It slips easily off the tongue, and it would\nbe hard to replace. Recently, however, several workers have postulated types of\nhabitable bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar habitable\nzone (HZ). These include not only bodies which orbit at substantial distances\nfrom their parent stars, but also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained\ninternal oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with\ngeothermally-maintained surface oceans, which have been ejected from unstable\nplanetary systems into interstellar space. If habitability is not a unique and\ndiagnostic property of the HZ, then the value of the term has been compromised\nin a fundamental way. At the same time, it has become evident that multiple\nenvironmental states, differing in important ways in their habitability, are\npossible even for geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of\ninsolation, within the classic HZ. We discuss an approach to investigations of\nplanetary habitability which focuses on planetary-scale ecosystems, which are\nhere termed - ecospheres. This is following a usage popular amongst ecologists,\nsuch as Huggett (1999), rather than that of authors such as Strughold (1953)\nand Dole (1964), who used it as a term for the HZ. This approach emphasizes\necodynamic perspectives, which explore the dynamic interactions between the\nbiotic and abiotic factors which together comprise ecosystems.\n", "authors": "Martin J.

We used the adaptive-optics-fed integral field\nspectrograph SINFONI to obtain high quality medium-resolution spectra of AB Pic\nb (R = 1500-2000) over the 1.1 - 2.5 microns range. Our analysis relies on the\ncomparison of our spectra to young standard templates and to the latest\nlibraries of synthetic spectra developed by the Lyon's Group. AB Pic b is\nconfirmed to be a young early-L dwarf companion. We derive a spectral type\nL0-L1 and find several features indicative of intermediate gravity atmosphere.\nA comparison to synthetic spectra yields Teff = 2000+100-300 K and log(g) = 4\n+- 0.5 dex. The determination of the derived atmospheric parameters of AB Pic b\nis limited by a non-perfect match of current atmosphere spectra with our\nnear-infrared observations of AB Pic b. The current treatment of dust settling\nand missing molecular opacity lines in the atmosphere models could be\nresponsible. By combining the observed photometry, the surface fluxes from\natmosphere models and the known distance of the system, we derive new mass,\nluminosity and radius estimates of AB Pic b.

Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity, it is\nunlikely to work for the much heavier, refractory elements.

Using a\npopulation model, we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced with\na self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between\n15-120AU. Disks must have this 15AU minimum radius to show a peak in disk\nfraction, rather than a monotonic decline.

This conclusion,\nthat debris disks are narrow belts, is independent of the significance of 24um\ntrends for young A-stars. We show that the statistics can also be reproduced\nwith a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearby\neccentric planet.

Our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for Earth-like\nplanets around Sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermal\ninertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. Since\nplanets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from the\nstar, such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for direct\nobservations with missions such as TPF-Darwin. Nevertheless, the extreme\ntemperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-Earths raise questions\nabout the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitable\nconditions.\n", "authors": "Courtney D.

There is evidence that Earth has\ngone through at least one globally frozen, \"snowball\" state in the last billion\nyears, which it is thought to have exited after several million years because\nglobal ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle, thereby allowing\ngreenhouse gases to build up to sufficient concentration to melt the ice. Due\nto the positive feedback caused by the high albedo of snow and ice,\nsusceptibility to falling into snowball states might be a generic feature of\nwater-rich planets with the capacity to host life. This paper has two main\nthrusts. First, we revisit one-dimensional energy balance climate models as\ntools for probing possible climates of exoplanets, investigate the dimensional\nscaling of such models, and introduce a simple algorithm to treat the melting\nof the ice layer on a globally-frozen planet. We show that if a terrestrial\nplanet undergoes Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity that are of\ngreat enough magnitude, it could melt out of a snowball state. Second, we\nexamine the kinds of variations of eccentricity that a terrestrial planet might\nexperience due to the gravitational influence of a giant companion. We show\nthat a giant planet on a sufficiently eccentric orbit can excite extreme\neccentricity oscillations in the orbit of a habitable terrestrial planet. More\ngenerally, these two results demonstrate that the longterm habitability (and\nastronomical observables) of a terrestrial planet can depend on the detailed\narchitecture of the planetary system in which it resides.\n", "authors": "David S.

Several\nnumerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speed\nvaries with heat flux and viscosity, but no previous theories have been\nadvanced to explain these trends. Here, we show using simple arguments that if\nconvective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them,\nthe mean jet speeds split into two regimes. When the convection is weakly\nnonlinear, the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with F/nu,\nwhere F is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity. When the\nconvection is strongly nonlinear, the jet speeds are faster and should scale\napproximately as (F/nu)^{1/2}. We demonstrate how this regime shift can\nnaturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiency\nwith heat flux and viscosity. Moreover, the simulations hint at a third regime\nwhere, at sufficiently small viscosities, the jet speed becomes independent of\nthe viscosity. We show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regime\nexists, mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power. Our\nscalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previous\nBoussinesq and anelastic, three-dimensional simulations of convection within\ngiant planets over a broad range of parameters. When extrapolated to the real\nheat fluxes, these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in the\nmolecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker--by an order of\nmagnitude or more--than the speeds measured at cloud level.\n", "authors": "Adam P.

Methods: We simulated a steady-state distribution of dust\nparticles outside 10AU with a collisional code and in the inner region (r<10AU)\nwith single-particle numerical integrations.

Its importance stems from\nthe expected substantial jump in the abundance of solids beyond the snow line,\nwhich is conducive to planet formation, and from the higher stickiness in\ncollisions of ice-coated dust grains, which may help the process of coagulation\nof dust and the formation of planetesimals. In an optically thin nebula, the\nlocation of the snow line is easily calculated to be around 3 AU. However, in\nits first 5 to 10 million years, the solar nebula was optically thick, implying\na smaller snow line radius due to shielding from direct sunlight, but also a\nlarger radius because of viscous heating. Several models have attempted to\ntreat these opposing effects. However, until recently treatments beyond an\napproximate 1+1D radiative transfer were unfeasible. We revisit the problem\nwith a fully self-consistent 3D treatment in an axisymmetric disk model,\nincluding a density-dependent treatment of the dust and ice sublimation. We\nfind that the location of the snow line is very sensitive to the opacities of\nthe dust grains and the mass accretion rate of the disk. We show that previous\napproximate treatments are quite efficient at determining the location of the\nsnow line if the energy budget is locally dominated by viscous accretion.

Using solar abundances of the\nelements we compute the abundance of dust and ice and find that the expected\njump in solid surface density at the snow line is smaller than previously\nassumed.

Flow through such discs\nmay provide most of the mass to gas giant planets, and such discs are likely\nsites for the formation of regular satellites. We model these discs as\naccretion discs subject to the tidal forces of the central star. The tidal\ntorques from the star remove the disc angular momentum near the disc outer edge\nand permit the accreting disc gas to lose angular momentum at the rate\nappropriate for steady accretion. Circumplanetary discs are truncated near the\nradius where periodic ballistic orbits cross, where tidal forces on the disc\nare strong. This radius occurs at approximately 0.4 r_H for the planet Hill\nradius r_H. During the T Tauri stage of disc accretion, the disc is fairly\nthick with aspect ratio H/r > 0.2 and the disc edge tapering occurs over a\nradial scale ~ H ~ 0.1 r_H. For a circular or slightly eccentric orbit planet,\nno significant resonances lie within the main body of the disc. Tidally driven\nwaves involving resonances nonetheless play an important role in truncating the\ndisc, especially when it is fairly thick. We model the disc structure using one\ndimensional time-dependent and steady-state models and also two dimensional SPH\nsimulations. The circumplanetary disc structure depends on the variation of the\ndisc turbulent viscosity with radius and is insensitive to the angular\ndistribution of the accreting gas. Dead zones may occur within the\ncircumplanetary disc and result in density structures. If the disc is turbulent\nthroughout, the predicted disc structure near the location of the regular\nJovian and Saturnian satellites is smooth with no obvious feature that would\nfavor formation at their current locations.\n", "authors": "Rebecca G.

After\nintroducing a number of observational constraints from the solar system, from\nobserved protoplanetary disks, and from the extrasolar planets, we simplify the\nproblem by dividing it into a number of discrete stages which are assumed to\noccur in a sequential way. In the first stage - the growth from dust to\nkilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central\nimportance. We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode, as well as a\ngravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust. In the\nnext stage, planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size.\nGravity is now the dominant force. The mass accretion can be strongly\nnon-linear, leading to the detachment of a few big bodies from the remaining\nplanetesimals. In the outer planetary system (outside a few AU), some of these\nbodies can become so massive that they eventually accrete a large gaseous\nenvelope.

High-resolution global hydrodynamical and\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of turbulent protoplanetary\ndisks were used to infer the properties of the flow in such disks. By\nperforming hydrodynamic simulations using explicit viscosity, we demonstrate\nthat our numerical setup does not suffer from any numerical artifact. The\naforementioned meridional circulation is easily recovered in viscous and\nlaminar disks and is quickly established. In MHD simulations, the\nmagnetorotational instability drives turbulence in the disks. Averaging out the\nturbulent fluctuations on a long timescale, the results fail to show any\nlarge-scale meridional circulation. A detailed analysis of the simulations show\nthat this lack of meridional circulation is due to the turbulent stress tensor\nhaving a vertical profile different from the viscous stress tensor. A simple\nmodel is provided that successfully accounts for the structure of the flow in\nthe bulk of the disk. In addition to those results, possible deviations from\nstandard vertically averaged alpha disk models are suggested by the simulations\nand should be the focus of future work. Global MHD numerical simulations of\nfully ionized and turbulent protoplanetary disks are not consistent with the\nexistence of a large-scale meridional flow.

In\nthe terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratio\nbetween the Hill radius and physical size of the planetesimals is relatively\nsmall. Although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearly\ndemonstrated that the accretion process in the TNO region is quite different\nfrom that in the terrestrial planet region.

This dynamical configuration likely resulted from\nresonance capture as Neptune migrated outward during the late stages of planet\nformation. The details of Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, including\nits radial extent and the concurrent eccentricity evolution of the planet, are\nthe subject of considerable debate. Two qualitatively different proposals for\nresonance capture have been proposed--migration-induced capture driven by\nsmooth outward evolution of Neptune's orbit and chaotic capture driven by\ndamping of the planet's eccentricity near its current semi-major axis. We\ndemonstrate that the distribution of comparable-mass, wide-separation binaries\noccupying resonant orbits can differentiate between these two scenarios. If\nmigration-induced capture occurred, this fraction records information about the\nformation locations of different populations of KBOs. Chaotic capture, in\ncontrast, randomizes the orbits of bodies as they are placed in resonance. In\nparticular, migration-induced capture produces the following signatures. The\n2:1 resonance should contain a dynamically cold component, with inclinations\nless than 5-10 degrees, having a binary fraction comparable to that among cold\nclassical KBOs. If the 3:2 resonance also hosts a cold component, its binary\nfraction should be 20-30% lower than in the cold classical belt.

This assumes that\nsome fraction of the mass scattered into the inner planetary system ends up on\nstar-grazing orbits, is tidally disrupted and accreted onto the white dwarf.\nThe simulations also reproduce the observed decrease in accretion rate with\ncooling age and predict accretion rates in old (>1Gyr) white dwarfs, in line\nwith observations. The efficiency we assumed for material scattered into the\ninner planetary system to end up on star-grazing orbits is based on a\nSolar-like planetary system, since the simulations show that a single planet is\nnot sufficient. Although the correct level of accretion is reproduced, the\nsimulations predict a higher fraction of accreting white dwarfs than observed.\nThis could indicate that evolved planetary systems are less efficient at\nscattering bodies onto star-grazing orbits or that dynamical instabilities\npost-stellar mass loss cause rapid planetesimal belt depletion for a\nsignificant fraction of systems.\n", "authors": "Amy Bonsor, Alexander Mustill, Mark Wyatt"}, {"category": "astro-ph.EP", "pubdate": "2011-02-16T11:55:41Z", "title": "Bayesian re-analysis of the radial velocities of Gliese 581.

Methods: A thermal\nevolution model for super-Earths is used to calculate the sources and sinks of\natmospheric carbon dioxide. The habitable zone is determined by the limits of\nphotosynthetic biological productivity on the planetary surface. Models with\ndifferent ratios of land / ocean coverage are pursued. Results: The maximum\ntime span for habitable conditions is attained for water worlds at a position\nof about 0.14+/-0.015 AU, which deviates by just a few percent (depending on\nthe adopted stellar luminosity) from the actual position of Gl 581g, an\nestimate that does however not reflect systematic uncertainties inherent in our\nmodel.

Here we present five new models of the\nevolution of disks with inner radii of 20 AU and outer radii of 60 AU, for\ncentral protostars with masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 $M_\\odot$, in\norder to assess the likelihood of planet formation on wide orbits around stars\nwith varied masses. The disk masses range from 0.028 $M_\\odot$ to 0.21\n$M_\\odot$, with initial Toomre $Q$ stability values ranging from 1.1 in the\ninner disks to $\\sim 1.6$ in the outer disks. These five models show that disk\ninstability is capable of forming clumps on time scales of $\\sim 10^3$ yr that,\nif they survive for longer times, could form giant planets initially on orbits\nwith semimajor axes of $\\sim$ 30 AU to $\\sim$ 70 AU and eccenticities of $\\sim$\n0 to $\\sim$ 0.35, with initial masses of $\\sim 1 M_{Jup}$ to $\\sim 5 M_{Jup}$,\naround solar-type stars, with more protoplanets forming as the mass of the\nprotostar (and protoplanetary disk) are increased. In particular, disk\ninstability appears to be a likely formation mechanism for the HR 8799 gas\ngiant planetary system.\n", "authors": "Alan P.

We include the stabilizing effects of turbulent\ndiffusion, which suppresses small scale GI. The radially wide rings that do\ncollapse contain up to $\\sim 0.1$ Earth masses of solids. Subsequent\nfragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically\nhomogenous planetesimals. Particle radial drift time scales (and, to a lesser\nextent, disk lifetimes and sizes) restrict the viability of secular GI to disks\nwith weak turbulent diffusion, characterized by $\\alpha \\lesssim 10^{-4}$.

This minimum is\nlikely due to the Christiansen Effect, a reduction in the extinction of small\nparticles when their (complex) refractive index is close to that of the\nsurrounding medium. Simple Mie-scattering models demonstrate that the strength\nof this opacity dip is sensitive to the size distribution of particles between\n1 and 100 microns across. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of the\noccultation data is sufficient to reveal variations in the transmission spectra\nwithin and among these rings.

Such differential forces produce a\nwind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For\nany two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the\ndifferential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual\ngravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius\ncould be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more\nimportant role than tidal perturbations by the star.

We then\ndiscuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary\nplanetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than\ntheir WISH radius.

To\nperform this investigation, we introduce fundamental concepts of conservative\nand dissipative dynamics of the three-body problem. Based on these concepts, we\ndevelop a qualitative model of the secular evolution of the migrating planetary\npair. Our approach is based on analysis of the energy and the orbital angular\nmomentum exchange between the two-planet system and an external medium; thus no\nspecific kind of dissipative forces is invoked. We show that, under assumption\nthat dissipation is weak and slow, the evolutionary routes of the migrating\nplanets are traced by the Mode I and Mode II stationary solutions of the\nconservative secular problem. The ultimate convergence and the evolution of the\nsystem along one of these secular modes of motion is determined uniquely by the\ncondition that the dissipation rate is sufficiently smaller than the proper\nsecular frequency of the system.

The\nscheme treats the steady state portion of the cascade by equating mass loss and\ngain in each size bin; the smallest particles are expected to reach steady\nstate on their collision timescale, while larger particles retain their\nprimordial distribution. For collision-dominated disks, steady state means that\nmass loss rates in logarithmic size bins are independent of size. This\nprescription reproduces the expected two phase size distribution, with ripples\nabove the blow-out size, and above the transition to gravity-dominated\nplanetesimal strength. The scheme also reproduces the expected evolution of\ndisk mass, and of dust mass, but is computationally much faster than evolving\ndistributions forward in time. For low-mass disks, P-R drag causes a turnover\nat small sizes to a size distribution that is set by the redistribution\nfunction (the mass distribution of fragments produced in collisions).

We use Monte-Carlo simulations\nto describe the formation time scales of ice mantles on bare grains in\nprotostellar disks and massive protostars environments. Then we analytically\ndescribe these two systems in terms of grain populations subject to infall and\nturbulence, and assume steady-state. Results. Our results show that there is an\nextended region beyond the snow line where icy and bare grains can coexist, in\nboth proto-planetary disks and massive protostars.

Our second approach consist in the analysis of the stationary\nsolutions of mean equations of motion based on a Hamiltonian formalism.

Abridged. Many stars are members of binary systems. During early\nphases when the stars are surrounded by discs, the binary orbit and disc\nmidplane may be mutually inclined. The discs around T Tauri stars will become\nmildly warped and undergo solid body precession around the angular momentum\nvector of the binary system. It is unclear how planetesimals in such a disc\nwill evolve and affect planet formation. Aims. We investigate the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in discs that are perturbed by a binary companion on a\ncircular, inclined orbit. We examine collisional velocities of the\nplanetesimals to determine when they can grow through accretion. We vary the\nbinary inclination, binary separation, D, disc mass, and planetesimal radius.\nOur standard model has D=60 AU, inclination=45 deg, and a disc mass equivalent\nto the MMSN. Methods. We use a 3D hydrodynamics code to model the disc.\nPlanetesimals are test particles which experience gas drag, the gravitational\nforce of the disc, the companion star gravity. Planetesimal orbit crossing\nevents are detected and used to estimate collisional velocities. Results. For\nbinary systems with modest inclination (25 deg), disc gravity prevents\nplanetesimal orbits from undergoing strong differential nodal precession (which\noccurs in absence of the disc), and forces planetesimals to precess with the\ndisc on average. For bodies of different size the orbit planes become modestly\nmutually inclined, leading to collisional velocities that inhibit growth. For\nlarger inclinations (45 degrees), the Kozai effect operates, leading to\ndestructively large relative velocities. Conclusions. Planet formation via\nplanetesimal accretion is difficult in an inclined binary system with\nparameters similar to those considered in this paper. For systems in which the\nKozai mechanism operates, the prospects for forming planets are very remote.\n", "authors": "M. M. Fragner, R. P. Nelson, W.

In these calculations, key\nparameters such as surface pressure and CO2 concentration as well as orbital\ndistance and planetary mass are varied.\n  Results imply that surface temperatures above freezing could be obtained,\nindependent of the here considered atmospheric scenarios, at an orbital\ndistance of 0.117 AU. For an orbital distance of 0.146 AU, CO2 concentrations\nas low as 10 times the present Earth's value are sufficient to warm the surface\nabove the freezing point of water. At 0.175 AU, only scenarios with CO2\nconcentrations of 5% and 95% were found to be habitable. Hence, an additional\nSuper-Earth planet in the GL 581 system in the previously determined dynamical\nstability range would be considered a potentially habitable planet.\n", "authors": "P. von Paris, S.

Due to their proximity to their host star, rings around\nsuch exoplanets must primarily consist of rocky materials. However, we find\nthat despite the higher densities of rock compared to ice, most of the observed\nextrasolar planets with reliable radii measurements have sufficiently large\nRoche radii to support rings. For the currently known transiting extrasolar\nplanets, Poynting-Robertson drag is not effective in significantly altering the\ndynamics of individual ring particles over a time span of $10^8$ years provided\nthat they exceed about 1 m in size. In addition, we show that significantly\nsmaller ring particles can exist in optically thick rings, for which we find\ntypical ring lifetimes ranging from a few times $10^6$ to a few times $10^9$\nyears. Most interestingly, we find that many of the rings could have nontrivial\nLaplacian planes due to the increased effects of the orbital quadrupole caused\nby the exoplanets' proximity to their host star, allowing a constraint on the\n$J_2$ of extrasolar planets from ring observations. This is particular\nexciting, since a planet's $J_2$ reveals information about its interior\nstructure. Furthermore, measurements of an exoplanet's oblateness and of its\n$J_2$, from warped rings, would together place limits on its spin period. Based\non the constraints that we have derived for extrasolar rings, we anticipate\nthat the best candidates for ring detections will come from transit\nobservations by the Kepler spacecraft of extrasolar planets with semi-major\naxes $\\sim 0.1$ AU and larger.\n", "authors": "Hilke E.

The perturbations from the Sun acting on Triton cause it to spend\na long time in its high-eccentricity phase, usually of the order of 10 Myr,\nwhile the typical time to circularise to its current orbit is some 200 Myr. The\ncurrent orbit of Triton is consistent with an origin through binary capture and\ntidal evolution, even though the model prefers Triton to be closer to Neptune\nthan it is today. The probability of capturing Triton in this manner is\napproximately 0.7%. Since the capture of Triton was at most a 50% event --\nsince only Neptune has one, but Uranus does not -- we deduce that in the\nprimordial trans-Neptunian disc there were 100 binaries with at least one\nTriton-sized member. Morbidelli et al. (2009) concludes there were some 1000\nTriton-sized bodies in the trans-Neptunian proto-planetary disc, so the\nprimordial binary fraction with at least one Triton-sized member is 10%. This\nvalue is consistent with theoretical predictions, but at the low end. If Triton\nwas captured at the same time as Neptune's irregular satellites, the far\nmajority of these, including Nereid, would be lost. This suggests either that\nTriton was captured on an orbit with a small semi-major axis a < 50 R_N (a rare\nevent), or that it was captured before the dynamical instability of the Nice\nmodel, or that some other mechanism was at play. The issue of keeping the\nirregular satellites remains unresolved.\n", "authors": "E. Nogueira, R. Brasser, R.

In the limit of weak\nthermal ionization, ohmic dissipation increases with the planetary equilibrium\ntemperature (T_eq >~ 1000 K) faster than the insolation power does, eventually\nreaching values >~ 1% of the insolation power, which may be sufficient to\ninflate the radii of hot Jupiters. At higher T_eq values still, magnetic drag\nrapidly brakes the atmospheric winds, which reduces the associated ohmic\ndissipation power. For example, for a planetary field strength B=10G, the\nfiducial scaling laws indicate that ohmic dissipation exceeds 1% of the\ninsolation power over the equilibrium temperature range T_eq ~ 1300-2000 K,\nwith a peak contribution at T_eq ~ 1600 K.
