While about\nhalf of the extragalactic sources have been optically identified with Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN), only a meagre 10% of the galactic sources have a\nreliable identification. This low success rate has mainly to be ascribed to the\nlocal crowding of potential optical counterparts and to the large gamma-ray\nerror boxes (of the order of one degree in radius) which prevented a\nstraightforward optical identification. Indeed, a multi-wavelength\nidentification strategy, based on a systematic coverage of the gamma-ray error\nboxes, has been the only do-able approach.

However,\nthe lack of the detection of a neutron star or pulsar formed in the SN 1987A\nstill remains an unsolved mystery. In this paper we suggest that the newly\nformed neutron star at the center of SN1987A may undergo a phase transition\nafter the neutrino trapping time scale (~10 s). Consequently the compact\nremnant of SN 1987A may be a strange quark star, which has a softer equation of\nstate than that of neutron star matter. Such a phase transition can induce the\nstellar collapse and result in a large amplitude stellar oscillations. We use a\nthree dimensional Newtonian hydrodynamic code to study the time evolution of\nthe temperature and density at the neutrinosphere. Extremely intense pulsating\nneutrino fluxes, with submillisecond period and with neutrino energy (> 30 MeV)\ncan be emitted because the oscillations of the temperature and density are out\nof phase almost 180 degree.

Our simulations show that for Comptonization of disk and CMB\nphotons, the degree of polarization of the scattered photons increases with the\nviewing inclination angle with respect to the jet axis. In both cases the\nmaximum linear polarization is approximately 20%. In the case of synchrotron\nself-Comptonization (SSC), we find that the resulting X-ray polarization\ndepends strongly on the seed synchrotron photon injection site, with typical\nfractional polarizations of approximately P = 10 - 20% when synchrotron\nemission is localized near the jet base, while P = 20 - 70% for the case of\nuniform emission throughout the jet.

We combine a simple theory for electron\ncooling in SNRs with the observed radio luminosities to estimate the remnant\nmagnetic field strength (B_SNR): the correlation between L and Sigma implies\nthat B_SNR also increases with Sigma. We explore two interpretations of this\ncorrelation: (1) B_SNR is generated by post-shock magnetic field amplification,\nwith B_SNR^2 proportional to Sigma and (2) B_SNR results from shock-compression\nof the ambient ISM magnetic field (B_ISM), with B_ISM being larger in denser\ngalaxies. We find that shock compression is, on average, sufficient to produce\nthe observed radio emission from SNRs in the densest starbursts; amplification\nof post-shock magnetic fields is not required. By contrast, in normal spirals\npost-shock field amplification (by a factor of a few - 10) is consistent with\nthe data; we find tentative evidence that both the Alfven speed and the ratio\nof B_SNR^2 to the post-shock pressure (\"epsilon_B\") are constant in SNRs from\ngalaxy to galaxy. We discuss observational tests that can be used to\ndistinguish between these two interpretations of the radio luminosities of\nSNRs. Regardless of which is correct, the radio emission from SNRs provides an\nupper limit to B_ISM that is independent of the minimum energy assumption.

Each\nperiastron passage changes the orbital parameters in such a way that the orbit\nbecomes more and more eccentric and the angular momentum approaches the\ncritical value for tidal capture. When this value is reached, the body is\nsuddenly caught by the relativistic potential to the last periastron (occurring\nat two Schwarzschild radii for a non rotating black hole). In this process the\ntransfer of orbital into internal energy heats the body before it makes a few\nmore turns toward the horizon of the black hole. Because of strong relativistic\neffects this last bright message from the object is seen as a quasi-periodic\nflare. Assuming that a black hole may be fed by a large number of such small\ndebris we calculate light curves expected from such events. We investigate the\nresemblance of the Fourier spectra of such light curves with those of observed\nQPOs.\n", "authors": "U. Kostic, A. Cadez, A.

We prescribe the magnetic flux advection\nrate to determine the azimuthal magnetic flux at a given radius.\n  We find magnetically supported, thermally stable solutions for both optically\nthin and thick disks, in which the heating enhanced by the strong magnetic\nfield balances the radiative cooling. The temperature in a low-$\\beta$ disk is\nlower than that in an ADAF/RIAF but higher than that in a standard disk. We\nalso study the radial dependence of the thermal equilibrium solutions.\n  The optically thin, low-$\\beta$ branch extends to $ \\dot M \\gtrsim 0.1 {\\dot\nM}_{\\rm Edd}$, in which the temperature anti-correlates with the mass accretion\nrate.

Such disks will be observed as\nstaying in a high/soft state.

The outburst (L_X = 3* 10^38 erg/s \\approx L_EDD) spectrum could be\nmodeled successfully using a cutoff powerlaw, a cold disk emission, a hot\nblackbody, and a cyclotron absorption line. The magnetic field and\nmagnetospheric radius could be constrained. The thickness of the inner\naccretion disk is broadened to a width of 75 km. The hot blackbody component\nfeatures sinusoidal modulations indicating that the bulk of the hard X-ray\nemission is emitted preferentially along the magnetic equator.

Our picture capitalizes on an important element of the MHD\nrepresentation of the magnetosphere, namely the separatrix between the\ncorotating closed-line region (the `dead zone') and the open field lines that\noriginate in the polar caps. Along the separatrix flows the return current that\ncorresponds to the main magnetospheric electric current emanating from the\npolar caps. Across the separatrix, both the toroidal and poloidal components of\nthe magnetic field change discontinuously. The poloidal component discontinuity\nrequires the presence of a significant annular electric current which has up to\nnow been unaccounted for. We estimate the position and thickness of this\nannular current at the tip of the closed line region, and show that it consists\nof electrons (positrons) corotating with Lorentz factors on the order of 10^5,\nemitting incoherent synchrotron radiation that peaks in the hard X-rays. These\nparticles stay in the region of highest annular current close to the equator\nfor a path-length of the order of one meter.

We interpret flares and off states as being due to the\nstrongly structured wind of the optical companion: when Vela X-1 encounters a\ncavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thus\npotentially triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits further\naccretion, thus giving rise to the off states. The required drop in density to\ntrigger the propeller effect in Vela X-1 is of the same order as predicted by\ntheoretical papers for the densities in the OB star winds. The same structured\nwind can give rise to the giant flares when Vela X-1 encounters a dense blob in\nthe wind.

The\nsignificant rms value in power density spectrum implies that the oscillation\ninvolves in the dynamical and non-linear variation of certain region of the\naccretion disk itself. The nature of the energy dependence implies that the\nregion which produces Comptonized hard tail is also responsible for QPOs.\nSimilarly, the occurrences of the QPOs are strongly related to the jet\nformation and the spectral states. These features are the natural consequences\nof the advective disk paradigm that we are advocating. In the mid 90s, some of\nthe present authors first pointed out that the QPOs in all possible types of\nblack holes may be simply due to the oscillations of the CENBOL, the\nCENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer which is formed in the\nsub-Keplerian flows around a black hole. This CENBOL could be axi-symmetric as\nwell as non-axisymteric in nature since its boundary, namely, the centrifugally\ndriven shocks could be axi-symmetric or non-axisymmetric. In addition, we\npointed out that the transition radius where the flow becomes Keplerian to\nsub-Keplerian, as well as the location of the inner sonic point can also\noscillate and produce the QPOs. Since the shock locations are functions of the\nspecific angular momentum ($\\lambda$) and specific energy (${\\cal E}$) of the\nflow, our model naturally predicts that the QPO frequency should vary with\nmass, spin, $\\lambda$ and ${\\cal E}$. The QPO frequencies with specific ratios,\nsuch as, 2:3 must be due to non-axisymmetric effects when the shock switches\nbetween the two-armed and the three-armed spirals.

However, in\ncalculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is\nconsidered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from\nthe receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,\nand includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival\ntime surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally\nrather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \\geq 1000$ d,\nwith the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total\nafterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In\noptical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the\npeak flux being $\\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the\nforward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very\ndifficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the\ncircum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding\njet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the\nreceding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked\nrebrightening.

Here only the linear optical and X-ray polarization that\ncharacterizes the PWNe synchrotron emission is analyzed in order to infer\ninformation on the inner bulk flow structure, to provide a direct investigation\nof the magnetic field configuration, in particular the presence and the\nstrength of a poloidal component, and to understand the origin of some emitting\nfeatures, such as the knot, whose origins are still uncertain. The inverse\nCompton radiation is examined to disentangle the different contributions to\nradiation from the magnetic field and the particle energy distribution\nfunction, and to search for a possible hadronic component in the emitting PWN,\nand thus for the presence of ions in the wind.

Here we report on far-ultraviolet (FUV)\nobservations of this X-ray binary, made with the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. From our Fourier spectral\nanalysis of the FUV timing data, we obtain a period of 693.5+/-1.3 s, which is\nsignificantly different from the orbital period. The light curve folded at this\nperiod can be described by a sinusoid, with a fractional semiamplitude of 6.3%\nand the phase zero (maximum of the sinusoid) at MJD 50886.015384+/-0.000043\n(TDB).

In this paper we propose a new\nmethod to derive bounds in the mchi - <sigmaA*v> plane by using radio continuum\nobservations of Messier 33, paying particular attention to a low emitting Radio\nCavity. The comparison of the expected radio emission due to the galactic dark\nmatter distribution with the observed one provides bounds which are comparable\nto those obtained from a similar analysis of the Milky Way. Remarkably, the\npresent results are simply based on archival data and thus largely improvable\nby means of specifically tailored observations. The potentiality of the method\ncompared with more standard searches is discussed by considering the optimistic\nsituation of a vanishing flux (within the experimental sensitivity) measured\ninside the cavity by a high resolution radio telescope like ALMA. Under the\nbest conditions our technique is able to produce bounds which are comparable to\nthe ones expected after five years of Fermi LAT data taking for an hadronic\nannihilation channel.

We discovered 11 type-I bursts\nwith INTEGRAL, and inspected 4 additional bursts: 2 recorded by XMM-Newton and\n2 by Swift. From the brigthest burst, we derive an upper limit on the source\ndistance of ~7 kpc.

Aims: We aim to compare the general relativistic (GR)\nresults by other groups with Newtonian calculations of models with equivalent\nparameters. We vary the mass ratios between NS and BH and the compactness of\nthe NS. The mass of the NS is 1.4 M_sol. We compare the dynamics in the\nparameter-space regions where the NS is expected to reach the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) before being tidally disrupted (mass shedding, MS) and\nvice versa. Methods: The hydrodynamics is evolved by a Newtonian PPM scheme\nwith four levels of nested grids. We use a polytropic EoS (Gamma=2), as was\ndone in the GR simulations. However, instead of full GR we use a Newtonian\npotential supplemented by a Paczynski-Wiita-Artemova potential for the BH, both\ndisregarding and including rotation of the BH. Results: If the NS is compact\n(C=0.18) it is accreted by the BH more quickly, and only a small amount of mass\nremains outside the BH. If the mass ratio is small (Q=2 or 3) or the NS is less\ncompact (C=0.16 or less) the NS is tidally torn apart before being accreted.\nAlthough most of the mass is absorbed by the BH, some 0.1 M_sol remain in a\ntidal arm. For small mass ratios the tidal arm can wrap around the BH to form a\nthick disk. When including the effects of BH spin-up or spin-down by the\naccreted matter, more mass remains in the surroundings (0.2-0.3 M_sol).\nConclusions: Although details and quantitative results differ, the general\ntrends of our Newtonian calculations are similar to the GR calculations.

We investigate the X-ray emission in the\n20-40 keV band expected from the flaring low-mass stellar population in Cygnus\nOB2. We discuss whether such emission needs to be considered in the\ninterpretation of existing and future X-ray observations of the region, and\nwhether such observations might provide insight into the high-energy processes\non low-mass pre-main sequence stars. Methods. The total hard X-ray flux from\nlow-mass stars is estimated by assuming the observed soft X-ray emission stems\nfrom a superposition of flares.

The mass loss history of the progenitor star\nstrongly affects the shape of the Supernova remnant (SNR). In this paper we\ninvestigate whether the progenitor star of Cas A had a WR phase or not and how\nlong it may have lasted. We performed two-dimensional multi-species\nhydrodynamical simulations of the CSM around the progenitor star for several WR\nlife times, each followed by the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the\nCSM. We then looked at the influence of the length of the WR phase and compared\nthe results of the simulations with the observations of Cas A. The difference\nin the structure of the CSM, for models with different WR life times, has a\nstrong impact on the resulting SNR. With an increasing WR life time the reverse\nshock velocity of the SNR decreases and the range of observed velocities in the\nshocked material increases. Furthermore, if a WR phase occurs, the remainders\nof the WR shell will be visible in the resulting SNR. Comparing our results\nwith the observations suggests that the progenitor star of Cas A did not have a\nWR phase. We also find that the quasi-stationary flocculi (QSF) in Cas A are\nnot consistent with the clumps from a WR shell that have been shocked and\naccelerated by the interaction with the SN ejecta.

While the unperturbed solutions are\ncontinuously self-similar, the log-periodicity of the density perturbations\nleads to a discrete self-similarity of the perturbations, i.e. the solution\nrepeats itself up to a scaling at discrete time intervals. We discuss these\nsolutions and verify them against numerical integrations of the time dependent\nhydrodynamic equations. Finally we show that this method can be generalized to\ntreat any small, spherically symmetric density perturbation by employing\nFourier decomposition.\n", "authors": "Yonatan Oren, Re'em Sari"}, {"category": "astro-ph.HE", "pubdate": "2009-07-10T16:28:24Z", "title": "A search for pulsations from the compact object of GRB 060218", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1801v3", "summary": "  A fraction of massive stars are expected to collapse into compact objects\n(accreting black holes or rapidly rotating neutron stars) that successfully\nproduce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

This shows a full cycle of the hysteresis in\ntransition between the hard and the soft states. The fact that the flux\nremained roughly constant for ~ two months at times prior to the spectral\ntransition to a high/soft state might be regarded as the result of balancing\nthe evaporation of the inner disk and the inward accretion flow, in a model in\nwhich the state transition is determined by the mass flow rate.

The star, and its accompanying disk, blow winds inside a cavity\ncleared out by an earlier jet. The collision of the winds with their\nsurroundings generates shock heated plasma which reaches temperatures up to\n~10^8 K. Attenuated X-ray spectra are calculated from solving the equation of\nradiative transfer along lines-of-sight. This process is repeated at various\nepochs throughout the simulations to examine the evolution of the intrinsic and\nattenuated flux. We find that the dynamic nature of the wind-cavity interaction\nfuels intrinsic variability in the observed emission on timescales of several\nhundred years. This is principally due to variations in the position of the\nreverse shock which is influenced by changes in the shape of the cavity wall.\nThe collision of the winds with the cavity wall can cause clumps of cloud\nmaterial to be stripped away. Mixing of these clumps into the winds mass-loads\nthe flow and enhances the X-ray emission measure.

These\ndata suggest that some other, most likely magnetic mechanisms have to be\nconsidered. The magnetic models do not require the development of accretion\ndisk within the first few seconds of the stellar collapse and hence do not\nrequire very rapidly rotating stellar cores at the pre-supernova state. This\nwidens the range of potential LGRB progenitors. In this paper, we re-examine\nthe close binary scenario allowing for the possibility of late development of\naccretion disks in the collapsar model and investigate the available range of\nmass accretion rates, black hole masses, and spins. A particularly interesting\nversion of the binary progenitor involves merger of a WR star with an\nultra-compact companion, neutron star or black hole. In this case we expect the\nformation of very long-lived accretion disks, that may explain the phase of\nshallow decay and X-ray flares observed by Swift.

The case for extinction is supported by a shallow optical\nto X-ray spectral index, consistent with the definition for ``dark bursts'',\nand a normal near-IR to X-ray spectral index. Moreover, a comparison to the\noptical discovery magnitudes of all short GRBs with optical afterglows\nindicates that the near-IR counterpart of GRB070724A is one of the brightest to\ndate, while its observed optical emission is one of the faintest. In the\ncontext of a non-afterglow origin, the near-IR emission may be dominated by a\nmini-supernova, leading to an estimated ejected mass of M~10^-4 Msun and a\nradioactive energy release efficiency of f~0.005 (for v~0.3c).

We analyze the concept that (secondary) parasitic\ninstabilities are responsible for the saturation of the MRI. Our approach\nenables us to explore dissipative regimes that are relevant to astrophysical\nand laboratory conditions that lie beyond the regime accessible to current\nnumerical simulations. We calculate the spectrum and physical structure of\nparasitic modes that feed off the fastest, exact (primary) MRI mode when its\namplitude is such that the fastest parasitic mode grows as fast as the MRI. We\nargue that this \"saturation\" amplitude provides an estimate of the magnetic\nfield that can be generated by the MRI before the secondary instabilities\nsuppress its growth significantly. Recent works suggest that the saturation\namplitude of the MRI depends mainly on the magnetic Prandtl number. Our results\nsuggest that, as long as viscous effects do not dominate the fluid dynamics,\nthe saturation level of the MRI depends only on the Elsasser number\n$\\Lambda_\\eta$.

The relationship T_B proportional to M_BH/mdot_E is a good fit, implying\nthat no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.\nLags between hard and soft X-ray bands as a function of Fourier timescale\nfollow similar patterns in AGN and BHBs.

The origin of such extended emission (found in about a quarter of Swift\nshort GRBs) is still unclear and may provide some clues to the identity of the\nelusive progenitors of short GRBs. The extended emission from GRB 080503 is\nfollowed by a rapid decay phase (RDP) that is detected over an unusually large\ndynamical range (one decade in time and ~3.5 decades in flux). We model the\nbroad envelope of extended emission and the subsequent RDP using a physical\nmodel (Genet & Granot 2009), in which the prompt emission (and its tail) is the\nsum of its individual pulses (and their tails). For GRB 080503, a single pulse\nfit is found to be unacceptable. The RDP displays very strong spectral\nevolution and shows some evidence for the presence of two spectral components\nwith different temporal behaviour, likely arising from distinct physical\nregions. A two pulse fit provides a much better fit to the data. The shallow\ngamma-ray and steep hard X-ray decays are hard to account for simultaneously,\nand require the second pulse to deviate from the simplest version of the model\nwe use. Therefore, while high latitude emission is a viable explanation for the\nRDP in GRB080503, it is quite plausible that another mechanism is at work here.\nFinally, we note that the properties of the RDP following the extended emission\nof short GRBs appear to have different properties than that following the\nprompt emission of long GRBs.

Quoted errors represent only statistical\nuncertainties.Our systematic error is estimated to be $\\sim 40 \\mu s$ and is\nmainly caused by the radio measurement uncertainties. In hard X-rays, the\naverage distance between the main pulse and interpulse on the phase plane is\n$0.3989\\pm0.0009$. To compare our findings in hard X-rays with the soft 2-20\nkeV X-ray band, we have used data of quasi-simultaneous Crab observations with\nthe PCA monitor on-board the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) mission. The\ntime lag and the pulses separation values measured in the 3-20 keV band are\n$0.00933\\pm0.00016$ (corresponding to $310\\pm6 \\mu s$) and $0.40016\\pm0.00028$\nparts of the cycle, respectively. While the pulse separation values measured in\nsoft X-rays and hard X-rays agree, the time lags are statistically different.\nAdditional analysis show that the delay between the radio and X-ray signals\nvaries with energy in the 2 - 300 keV energy range. We explain such a behaviour\nas due to the superposition of two independent components responsible for the\nCrab pulsed emission in this energy band.\n", "authors": "S. Molkov, E. Jourdain, J. P.

In particular, we find for the region surrounding RX\nJ1713-3946, that depending on the energy one is observing at, one may observe\nstartlingly different spectra or may not detect any enhanced emission with\nrespect to the diffuse emission contributed by background cosmic rays.

The description of energy state of a gas\nparticle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type\nenergy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of\nthe relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann\nform in the classical limit.\n  The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's\nsurface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's\nphysical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the\ninternal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer\nincreases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the\nquestion if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems\nto be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or,\nso far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a\ndistant observer.\n  In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form\nof the potential-type energy found in our previous work.

To\napply our results to the well-studied X-ray transient source GRO J1655-40, we\nadopted the observed mass of its black hole, and the observed properties of its\nX-ray radiation. To compare the results with the observations, we also computed\ntransmitted X-ray spectra based on the wind solution. Our main finding is: the\ndensity of the fast moving part of the wind is more than one order of magnitude\nlower than that inferred from the observations. Consequently, the model fails\nto predict spectra with line absorption as strong and as blueshifted as those\nobserved. However, despite the thermal wind being weak and Compton thin, the\nratio between the mass-loss rate and the mass accretion rate is about seven.\nThis high ratio is insensitive to the accretion luminosity, in the limit of\nlower luminosities. Most of the mass is lost from the disk between 0.07 and 0.2\nof the Compton radius. We discovered that beyond this range the wind solution\nis self-similar. In particular, soon after it leaves the disk, the wind flows\nat a constant angle with respect to the disk. Overall, the thermal winds\ngenerated in our comprehensive simulations do not match the wind spectra\nobserved in GRO J1655-40. This supports the conclusion of Miller et al. and\nKallman et al. that the wind in GRO J1655-40, and possibly other X-ray\ntransients, may be driven by magnetic processes.

With higher energy, the variability amplitude increases in the soft\nX-rays but decreases in the hard X-rays. The hard X-ray variability amplitude,\nhowever, is effectively large. For the first time, we detect a soft lag of\n~1000s between the soft and hard X-ray variations. The soft lags might become\nlarger with larger energy differences. The overall X-ray spectra exhibit a\nsofter-when-brighter trend, whereas the soft X-ray spectra appear to show a\nharder-when-brighter trend. The concave X-ray spectra of the source can be\ninterpreted as the sum of the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission,\ndominating in the soft X rays, and the low-energy end of the inverse Compton\n(IC) emission, contributing more in the hard X-rays. The synchrotron spectra\nare steep (\\Gamma~2.6), while the IC spectra are flat (\\Gamma~1.2). The\nsynchrotron spectra appear to harden with larger synchrotron fluxes, while the\nIC spectra seem to soften with larger IC fluxes. When the source brightens, the\nsynchrotron fluxes increase but the IC fluxes decrease. The synchrotron tail\nexhibits larger flux variations but smaller spectral changes than the IC\ncomponent does. The crossing energies between the two components and the trough\nenergies of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) increase when the source\nbrightens. The X-ray spectral variability demonstrates that the synchrotron and\nIC SED peaks of S5 0716+714 shift to higher energies when it brightens.\n", "authors": "You-Hong Zhang"}, {"category": "astro-ph.HE", "pubdate": "2010-03-25T13:28:14Z", "title": "Jet Precession Driven by Neutrino-Cooled Disc for Gamma-Ray Bursts", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4883v1", "summary": "  A model of jet precession driven by a neutrino-cooled disc around a spinning\nblack hole is present in order to explain the temporal structure and spectral\nevolution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

A weak correlation between the integrated near-UV luminosity and\nthe Halpha luminosity is also found for our complete sample, with a large\namount of scatter about the expected relation for photoionization by young\nstars. We detect Halpha emission out to the X-ray cooling radius, but no\nfurther, in several clusters and find a strong correlation between the Halpha\nluminosity contained in filaments and the X-ray cooling flow rate of the\ncluster, suggesting that the warm ionized gas is linked to the cooling flow.\nFurthermore, we detect a strong enhancement in the cooling properties of the\nICM coincident with the Halpha emission, compared to the surrounding ICM at the\nsame radius. While the filaments in a few clusters may be entrained by buoyant\nradio bubbles, in general, the radially-infalling cooling flow model provides a\nbetter explanation for the observed trends. The correlation of the Halpha and\nX-ray properties suggests that conduction may be important in keeping the\nfilaments ionized. The thinness of the filaments suggests that magnetic fields\nare an important part of channeling the gas and shielding it from the\nsurrounding hot ICM.\n", "authors": "Michael McDonald, Sylvain Veilleux, David S.

This leads to the postshock CR pressure less than 10% of\nthe shock ram pressure. If the Alfv'en speed is comparable to the sound speed\nin the preshock flow, as in the hot-phase ISM, the power-law slope of CR\nspectrum can be significantly softer than the canonical test-particle slope.\nThen the CR spectrum at the shock can be approximated by the revised\ntest-particle power-law with an exponential cutoff at the highest accelerated\nmomentum, p_{max}(t).

A 2005 imaging study showed that the halo is\nlimb-brightened, and suggested this feature is a candidate for the long-sought\nSNR shell. We present a spectral analysis of G21.5-0.9, using the longest\neffective observation to date (578.6 ks with ACIS, 278.4 ks with HRC) to study\nunresolved questions about the spectral nature of remnant features, such as the\nlimb-brightening of the X-ray halo and the bright knot in the northern part of\nthe halo. The Chandra analysis favours the non-thermal interpretation of the\nlimb. Its spectrum is well fit with a power-law model with a photon index\n$\\Gamma$ = 2.13 (1.94-2.33) and a luminosity of L_x (0.5-8 keV) = (2.3 +/- 0.6)\nx 10^33 erg/s (at an assumed distance of 5.0 kpc). An srcut model was also used\nto fit the spectrum between radio and X-ray energies.

The XMM monitoring campaign revealed\nsignificant variation of intrinsic absorbing column density along the orbit and\nof the Fe K{\\alpha} line equivalent width around the eclipses. The origin of\nthe soft X-ray absorption is modeled with an dense and extended hydrodynamical\ntail, trailing the neutron star. This structure extends along most of the\norbit, indicating that the stellar wind is strongly disrupted by the neutron\nstar. The variability of the absorbing column density suggests that the\nterminal velocity of the wind is smaller (~400 km/s) than observed in classical\nsystems. This can also explain the much stronger density perturbation inferred\nfrom the observations. Most of the Fe K{\\alpha} emission is generated in the\nmost inner region of the hydrodynamical tail. This region, that extends over a\nfew accretion radii, is ionized and does not contribute to the soft X-ray\nabsorption.

We systematically searched our data for X-ray counterparts of CNe\nand determined their X-ray light curves and spectral properties. Additionally,\nwe determined luminosity upper limits for all novae from previous studies which\nare not detected anymore and for all CNe in our field of view with optical\noutbursts between May 2005 and March 2007. We detected eight X-ray counterparts\nof CNe in M 31, four of which were not previously known. Seven sources can be\nclassified as SSSs, one is a candidate SSS. Two SSSs are still visible more\nthan nine years after the nova outburst, whereas two other nova counterparts\nshow a short SSS phase of less than 150 days. Of the latter sources, M31N\n2006-04a exhibits a short-time variable X-ray light curve with an apparent\nperiod of (1.6+-0.3) h. This periodicity could indicate the binary period of\nthe system. From the 14 SSS nova counterparts known from previous studies, ten\nare not detected anymore. Additionally, we found four SSSs in our XMM-Newton\ndata without a nova counterpart, one of which is a new source. Out of eleven\nSSSs detected in our monitoring, seven are counterparts of CNe. We therefore\nconfirm the earlier finding that CNe are the major class of SSSs in the central\nregion of M 31.

In 1992, Taylor,\none of the discoverers of this source, together with his collaborators proposed\na model of a compact object in an eccentric orbit accreting from the equatorial\nwind of the Be star primary. The application of this model by Marti & Paredes\n(1995) predicts one ejection at periastron and a second more displaced ejection\nalong the orbit. The first ejection should correspond to weak radio emission,\nbecause of strong inverse Compton losses of the emitting electrons due to the\nproximity to the hot Be star, whereas the second ejection, quite displaced from\nthe star, would correspond to a strong radio outburst, that one indeed\nobserved.

The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually\ninvoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are\ninitially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from\nthermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial\nacceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,\nusing two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We\nsystematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass\nratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due\nto the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with\nspectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated\nparticles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to\nthat of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA\nprocess.

Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust\nelectron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display\nnon-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic\nfields.

The other 40 percent display three types of decoupled\nbehaviours: i) chromatic optical light-curve breaks (perhaps due to the peak of\nthe synchrotron spectrum crossing the optical), ii) X-ray flux decays faster\nthan in the optical (suggesting that the X-ray emission is from local\ninverse-Compton scattering), and iii) chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks\n(indicating that the X-ray emission is from external up-scattering).\n", "authors": "A.

The BLRs in AGNs are believed to be\nassociated with the outflows from the accretion disks. Most of the\nlow-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) contain advection dominated accretion flows\n(ADAFs), which are very hot and have a positive Bernoulli parameter. ADAFs are\ntherefore associated with strong outflows. We estimate the cooling of the\noutflows from the ADAFs, and find that the gases in such hot outflows always\ncannot be cooled efficiently by bremsstrahlung radiation. The ADAF may co-exist\nwith the standard disk, i.e., the inner ADAF connects to the outer thin\naccretion disk at radius R_tr, in the sources accreting at slightly lower than\nthe critical rate. For the ADAFs with >0.001 L_edd, a secondary small inner\ncold disk is suggested to co-exist with the ADAF due to the condensation\nprocess. We estimate the Compton cooling of the outflow, of which the soft seed\nphotons either come from the outer cold disk or the secondary inner cold disk.\nIt is found that the gas in the outflow far from the ADAF may be efficiently\ncooled to form BLR clouds due to the soft seed photons emitted from the cold\ndisks, provided the transition radius of the ADAF to the outer cold disk is\nsmall or/and the secondary small cold disk has a luminosity >0.003L_edd. The\nBLR clouds can still be formed in the outflows from the outer cold thin disks,\nif the transition radius is not very large. For the sources with <0.001L_edd,\nthe inner small cold disk is evaporated completely in the ADAF and outer thin\naccretion disk may be suppressed by the ADAF, which leads to the disappearance\nof the BLR.

We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae.

The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a\nsubstantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from\ncoronae in cluster environment.

We present realistic evolutionary models of SD systems and\ncalculate durations of SSS phases. In most cases, accreting WDs spend a large\nfraction of time in the optically thick wind phase and the recurrent nova phase\nrather than the SSS phase. Thus the SSS phase lasts only for a few hundred\nthousand years. This is by a factor of ~10 shorter than those adopted by GB10\nwhere the SN~Ia progenitor WD was assumed to spend most of its life as a SSS.\nThe theoretical X-ray luminosity of the SSS has a large uncertainty because of\nthe uncertain atmospheric model of mass-accreting WDs and absorption of soft\nX-rays by the companion star's cool wind material. We thus adopt an average of\nthe observed fluxes of existing symbiotic SSSs, i.e., ~0.4 x 10^{36} erg s^{-1}\nfor 0.3--0.7 keV. Using these SSS duration and soft X-ray luminosity, we show\nthat the observed X-ray flux obtained by GB10 is rather consistent with our\nestimated flux in early type galaxies based on the SD scenario.

However, the AGNs found in\ndeep X-ray surveys are often too weak to allow direct measurement of the column\ndensity of obscuring matter. One method adopted in recent years to identify\nheavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs under such circumstances is to use the\nobserved mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio as a proxy for the column\ndensity. This is based on the supposition that the amount of energy lost by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum to the obscuring matter and reprocessed into\ninfrared emission is directly related to the column density and that the proxy\nis not sensitive to other physical parameters of the system (aside from\ncontamination by dust emission from, for example, star-forming regions). Using\nMonte Carlo simulations, we find that the energy losses experienced by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum in the obscuring matter are far more sensitive to\nthe shape of the X-ray continuum and to the covering factor of the X-ray\nreprocessor than they are to the column density of the material. Specifically\nwe find that it is possible for the infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio for a\nCompton-thin source to be just as large as that for a Compton-thick source even\nwithout any contamination from dust. Since the intrinsic X-ray continuum and\ncovering factor of the reprocessor are poorly constrained from deep X-ray\nsurvey data, we conclude that the mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio is not\na reliable proxy for the column density of obscuring matter in AGNs even when\nthere is no other contribution to the mid-infrared luminosity aside from X-ray\nreprocessing.

The rho cycle displays a high-amplitude, double-peaked flare that\nrecurs roughly every 50 s, and is sometimes referred to as the \"heartbeat\"\noscillation. The spectral and timing properties of the oscillation are\nconsistent with the radiation pressure instability and the evolution of a local\nEddington limit in the inner disk. We exploit strong variations in the X-ray\ncontinuum, iron emission lines, and the accretion disk wind to probe the\naccretion geometry over nearly six orders of magnitude in distance from the\nblack hole. At small scales (1-10 R_g), we detect a burst of bremsstrahlung\nemission that appears to occur when a portion of the inner accretion disk\nevaporates due to radiation pressure. Jet activity, as inferred from the\nappearance of a short X-ray hard state, seems to be limited to times near\nminimum luminosity, with a duty cycle of ~10%. On larger scales (1e5-1e6 R_g)\nwe use detailed photoionization arguments to track the relationship between the\nfast X-ray variability and the accretion disk wind. For the first time, we are\nable to show that changes in the broadband X-ray spectrum produce changes in\nthe structure and density of the accretion disk wind on timescales as short as\n5 seconds. These results clearly establish a causal link between the X-ray\noscillations and the disk wind and therefore support the existence of a\ndisk-jet-wind connection. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the mass loss\nrate in the wind may be sufficient to cause long-term oscillations in the\naccretion rate, leading to state transitions in GRS 1915+105.\n", "authors": "Joseph Neilsen, Ronald A.

Subtracting a late-time spectrum\nof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of SN2009nz and uncover broad\nfeatures typical of nearby GRB-SNe. This establishes unambiguously that\nGRB091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined Type Ic SN, and links a cosmological\nlong burst with a standard energy release (E_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to a\nmassive star progenitor. The spectrum of SN2009nz closely resembles that of\nSN2006aj, with SN2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but has\nsignificantly narrower features than SNe 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of a\nlower expansion velocity. The photospheric velocity inferred from the SiII 6355\nabsorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of SNe 2006aj\nand 2003dh than to the other GRB-SNe. Combining the measured velocity with the\nlight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosion\nparameters: M_Ni ~ 0.35 M_sun, E_K ~ 2.3e51 erg, and M_ej ~ 1.4 M_sun, similar\nto those of SN2006aj. These properties indicate that SN2009nz follows a trend\nof lower M_Ni for GRB-SNe with lower E_K and M_ej. Equally important, since\nGRB091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of SN2009nz to\nSN2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that XRF060218/SN2006aj was powered by\na neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encoded\nin the SN properties but not in the prompt emission.

In the turbulent shell, the magnetic field is amplified as a\nresult of turbulent dynamo action. In the case of a young supernova remnant,\nthe corresponding strength of the magnetic field is approximately 1 mG. The\npropagation speed of the shock wave is significantly stalled in the clouds\nbecause of the high density, while the shock maintains a high velocity in the\ndiffuse surrounding. In addition, when the shock wave hits the clouds,\nreflection shock waves are generated that propagate back into the shocked\nshell. From these simulation results, many observational characteristics of a\nyoung SNR RX J1713.7-3946 that is suggested to be interacting with molecular\nclouds, can be explained as follows: The reflection shocks can accelerate\nparticles in the turbulent downstream region where the magnetic field strength\nreaches 1mG, which causes short-time variability of synchrotron X-rays. Since\nthe shock velocity is stalled locally in the clouds, the temperature in the\nshocked cloud is suppressed below 1 keV. Thus, thermal X-ray line emissions\nwould be faint even if the SNR is interacting with molecular clouds. We also\nfind that the photon index of the $\\pi^0$-decay gamma rays generated by\ncosmic-ray protons can be 1.5, because the penetration depth of high-energy\nparticles into the clumpy clouds depends on their energy, which is consistent\nwith the recent gamma-ray observation by Fermi space telescope.\n", "authors": "Tsuyoshi Inoue, Ryo Yamazaki, Shu-ichiro Inutsuka, Yasuo Fukui"}, {"category": "astro-ph.HE", "pubdate": "2011-06-16T01:45:23Z", "title": "Modeling the hard TeV spectra of blazars 1ES 0229+200 and 3C 66A with an\n  internal absorption scenario", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3129v1", "summary": "  We study the applicability of the idea of internal absorption of gamma-rays\nproduced through synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic protons in highly\nmagnetized blobs to 1ES 0229+200 and 3C 66A, the two TeV blazars which show\nunusually hard intrinsic gamma-ray spectra after being corrected for the\nintergalactic absorption.

The\nestimated age of the cavity is t=7.9 x 10^7 years and the total work of the AGN\nis 3.3 x 10^59 erg, hence the cavity power is P_cav=1.3 x 10^44 erg/s.\nFurthermore, in the Chandra images of NGC545 and NGC541 we detected sharp\nsurface brightness edges, identified as merger cold fronts, and extended tails.\nUsing the pressure ratios between inside and outside the cold fronts we\nestimated that the velocities of NGC545 and NGC541 correspond to Mach-numbers\nof M=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.5} and M=0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.5}, respectively.

To understand the magnetic energy buildup in the\nmagnetar magnetosphere, a generalized magnetic virial theorem in the\nSchwarzschild metric is newly derived. We carefully address the question\nwhether the magnetar magnetospheric magnetic field can build up sufficient\nmagnetic energy to account for the work required to open up the magnetic field\nduring magnetar giant flares. We point out the importance of the Aly-Sturrock\nconstraint, which has been widely studied in solar corona mass ejections, as a\nreference state in understanding magnetar energy storage processes. We examine\nhow the magnetic field can possess enough energy to overcome the Aly-Sturrock\nenergy constraint and open up. In particular, general relativistic (GR) effects\non the Aly-Sturrock energy constraint in the Schwarzschild spacetime are\ncarefully investigated. It is found that, for magnetar outbursts, the\nAly-Sturrock constraint is more stringent, i.e., the Aly-Sturrock energy\nthreshold is enhanced due to the GR effects. In addition, neutron stars with\ngreater mass have a higher Aly-Sturrock energy threshold and are more difficult\nto erupt. This indicates that magnetars are probably not neutron stars with\nextreme mass.

However, the fact that angular\nmomentum transport in disks is mediated by MHD turbulence (with structure down\nto very small scales) raises the concern that the properties of the modeled\naccretion disks are affected by the finite numerical resolution of the\nsimulation. By implementing an orbital advection algorithm into the Athena code\nin cylindrical geometry, we have performed a set of global (but unstratified)\nNewtonian disk simulations extending up to resolutions previously unattained.\nWe study the convergence of these models as a function of spatial resolution\nand initial magnetic field geometry. The usual viscosity parameter ($\\alpha$)\nor the ratio of thermal-to-magnetic pressure ($\\beta$) are found to be poor\ndiagnostics of convergence, whereas the average tilt angle of the magnetic\nfield in the $(r,\\phi)$-plane is a very good diagnostic of convergence. We\nsuggest that this is related to the saturation of the MHD turbulence via\nparasitic modes of the magnetorotational instability.

We have analysed all RXTE observations since its\ndiscovery, archived optical spectroscopic and photometric data and obtained for\nthe first time near-IR spectra. The K-band spectrum shows HeI 20581 A and HI\n21660 A (Brackett-gamma) in emission, which confine the spectral type of the\ncompanion to be earlier than B2.5. The H-band spectrum exhibits the HI Br-18-11\nrecombination series in emission. The most prominent feature of the optical\nband spectrum is the strong emission of the Balmer line Halpha. The 4000-5000 A\nspectrum contains HeII and numerous HeI ines in absorption, indicating an early\nB-type star. The source shows three consecutive stages characterised by\ndifferent types of variability in the X-ray band: a smooth decay after the peak\nof a large outburst, large-amplitude flaring variability (reminiscent of type I\noytbursts) and quiescence. We observed that the spectrum becomes softer as the\nflux decreases and that this is a common characteristic of the X-ray emission\nfor all observing epochs.

With 2\nms timing resolution, IceCube can track subtle features in the temporal\ndevelopment of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the galactic\ncenter, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free megaton-scale\nsupernova search experiment. The sensitivity decreases to 20 standard\ndeviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (50 kpc).

For the first time the analysis is performed in 4 different\nX-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flare\ntemporal properties with energy. We find that flares are narrower at higher\nenergies: their width follows a power-law relation w~E^{-0.5} reminiscent of\nthe prompt emission. Flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time which\nis twice the rise time on average. Both time scales linearly evolve with time,\ngiving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both time\nscales are stretched by the same factor. As a consequence, the flare width\nlinearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearly\ndistinguishes the flare from the GRB prompt emission. The flare 0.3-10 keV peak\nluminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with large\nscatter: L_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. When multiple flares are present, a global\nsoftening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than the\nprevious one. The 0.3-10 keV isotropic energy distribution is a log-normal\npeaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. The flare\naverage spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to be a power-law with\nspectral energy index beta~1.1. These results confirmed that the flares are\ntightly linked to the prompt emission. However, after considering various\nmodels we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entire\nset of observations.\n", "authors": "G. Chincarini, J. Mao, R. Margutti, M. G.

We find a new\nmagnetic acceleration mechanism for such impulsive flows that can be much more\neffective than the acceleration of steady-state flows. This impulsive\nacceleration results in kinetic-energy-dominated flows at astrophysically\nrelevant distances from the central source. For a spherical flow, a discrete\nshell ejected from the source over a time t_0 with Lorentz factor Gamma~1 and\ninitial magnetization sigma_0 = B_0^2/(4 pi rho_0 c^2) >> 1 quickly reaches a\ntypical Lorentz factor Gamma ~ sigma_0^{1/3} and magnetization sigma ~\nsigma_0^{2/3} at the distance R_0 ~ ct_0. At this point the magnetized shell of\nwidth Delta ~ R_0 in the lab frame loses causal contact with the source and\ncontinues to accelerate by spreading significantly in its own rest frame. The\nexpansion is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient and leads to relativistic\nrelative velocities between the front and back of the shell. While the\nexpansion is roughly symmetric in the center of momentum frame, in the lab\nframe most of the energy and momentum remain in a region (or shell) of width\nDelta ~ R_0 at the head of the flow. This acceleration proceeds as Gamma ~\n(sigma_0 R/R_0)^{1/3} and sigma ~ sigma_0^{2/3} (R/R_0)^{-1/3} until reaching a\ncoasting radius R_c ~ R_0 sigma_0^2 where the kinetic energy becomes dominant:\nGamma ~ sigma_0 and sigma ~ 1 at R_c. Then the shell starts coasting and\nspreading (radially) causing its magnetization to drop as sigma ~ R_c/R at\nR>R_c. Given the typical variability time-scales of AGN and GRBs, the magnetic\nacceleration in these sources is a combination of the quasi-steady-state\ncollimation acceleration close to the source and the impulsive acceleration\nfurther out.

METHODS: Very High Energy\n(VHE; E > 100 GeV) observations of H 2356-309 were performed with the High\nEnergy Stereoscopic System (HESS) from 2004 through 2007. Simultaneous\noptical/UV and X-ray observations were made with the XMM-Newton satellite on\nJune 12/13 and June 14/15, 2005. NRT radio observations were also\ncontemporaneously performed in 2005.

The\nintegral flux above 240 GeV is I(>240 GeV) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61\n{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observed\nfrom the Crab Nebula. A time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 GeV\nto 2 TeV and is characterized by a power law (photon index of Gamma = 3.06 +-\n0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). Significant small-amplitude variations in the VHE\nflux from H 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not on\nshorter time scales. No evidence for any variations in the VHE spectral slope\nare found within these data.

In this paper we present\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the NDW which\ninclude accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction\nnetwork. Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities, we predict\nthe contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the\nentire supernova. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no true\nr-process occurs in the most basic scenario.

We can determine the inclination by modeling\nthe ellipsoidal modulations of the Roche-lobe filling donor star, but the\ncontamination of the donor star light from other components of the binary,\nparticularly the accretion disk, must be taken into account. To this end, we\ndetermined the donor star contribution to the infrared flux by comparing the\nspectra of V404 Cyg and Cen X-4 to those of various field K-stars of known\nspectral type. For V404 Cyg, we determined that the donor star has a spectral\ntype of K3 III. We determined the fractional donor contribution to the NIR flux\nin the H- and K-bands as $0.98 \\pm .05$ and $0.97 \\pm .09$, respectively. We\nremodeled the H-band light curve from \\citet{sanwal1996} after correcting for\nthe donor star contribution to obtain a new value for the binary inclination.\nFrom this, we determined the mass of the black hole in V404 Cyg to be $M_{BH}=\n9.0^{+.2}_{-.6}M_{\\odot}$. We performed the same spectral analysis for Cen X-4\nand found the spectral type of the donor star to be in the range K5 -- M1V. The\ndonor star contribution in Cen X-4 is $0.94\\pm.14$ in the H-band while in the\nK-band, the accretion disk can contribute up to 10% of the infrared flux. We\nremodeled the H-band light curve from \\citet{shahbaz1993}, again correcting for\nthe fractional contribution of the donor star to obtain the inclination. From\nthis, we determined the mass of the neutron star as $M_{NS}=\n1.5^{+.1}_{-.4}M_{\\odot}$. However, the masses obtained for both systems should\nbe viewed with some caution since contemporaneous light curve and spectral data\nare required to obtain definitive masses.\n", "authors": "Juthika Khargharia, Cynthia S.

In recent years a paradigm has arisen\nin which \"soft\" X-ray states are associated with an inner disc radius at, or\nvery close to, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black\nhole, while in \"hard\" X-ray states the inner edge of the disc is further from\nthe black hole. Models of advective flows suggest that as the X-ray luminosity\ndrops in hard states, the inner disc progressively recedes, from a few to\nhundreds gravitational radii. Recent observations which show broad iron line\ndetections and estimates of the disc component strength suggest that a\nnon-recessed disc could still be present in bright hard states. In this study\nwe present a comprehensive analysis of the spectral components associated with\nthe inner disc, utilising data from instruments with sensitive low-energy\nresponses and including reanalyses of previously published results. A key\ncomponent of the study is to fully estimate systematic uncertainties by e.g.\ninvestigating in detail the effect of having a hydrogen column density that is\nfixed or free to vary.

In general, the radiative intensity emitted by the photo-oval is\nnon-uniform and anisotropic. Furthermore, the photo-oval surface has a relative\nvelocity with respect to the comoving observer, and therefore, the observed\nintensity suffers from the Doppler effect and aberration. In addition, the\nbackground intensity usually depends on the optical depth. All of these\nintroduce the anisotropy to the radiation field observed by the comoving\nobserver. As a result, the relativistic Eddington factor $f$ generally depends\non the optical depth $\\tau$, the four velocity $u$, and the velocity gradient\n$du/d\\tau$. % In the case of a plane-parallel vertical flow, we found that the\nrelativistic variable Eddington factor $f$ generally decreases as the velocity\ngradient increases, but it increases as the velocity increases for some case.\nWhen the comoving radiation field is uniform, it is well approximated by $3f\n\\sim 1/[ 1+ ({16}/{15})(-{du}/{\\gamma d\\tau}) +(-{du}/{\\gamma d\\tau})^{1.6-2}\n  ]$.

The burst durations ranged from 0.4-1.8\\times103 s. The first five\nburst spectra are well modeled by blackbodies, with temperatures kT ~ 2-9 keV.\nHowever, the sixth burst had a complicated spectrum that is well characterized\nby a blackbody plus two emission features whose amplitude varied throughout the\nburst. The most prominent feature was at 14.0 keV. Upon entry into the active\nphase the pulsar showed a significant change in pulse morphology and a likely\ntiming glitch. The glitch had a total frequency jump of (1.9\\pm0.4)\\times10-7\nHz, which recovered with a decay time of 17\\pm 2 days by more than the initial\njump, implying a net spin-down of the pulsar. Within the framework of the\nmagnetar model, the net spin-down of the star could be explained by regions of\nthe superfluid that rotate slower than the rest. The bursts, flux enhancements,\nand pulse morphology changes can be explained as arising from crustal\ndeformations due to stresses imposed by the highly twisted internal magnetic\nfield.

Here we analyze the SDSS spectrum of the\nsource in detail. The spectrum was taken on 2001 February 1, when the source\nwas in a bright state and showed broad, double-peaked hydrogen and helium lines\n-- dramatically different from the G-type absorption spectrum seen from 2003\nonward. The lines are consistent with emission from a disk around the compact\nprimary. We derive properties of the disk by fitting the SDSS continuum with a\nsimple disk model, and find a temperature range of 2000--34000 K from the outer\nto inner edge of the disk. The disk inner and outer radii were approximately\n10^9 and 5.7x10^10 cm, respectively. These results further emphasize the unique\nfeature of the source: it is likely a system at the end of its transition from\nan X-ray binary to a recycled radio pulsar. The disk mass is estimated to have\nbeen ~10^23 g, most of which would have been lost due to pulsar wind ablation\n(or due to the propeller effect if the disk had extended inside the light\ncylinder of the pulsar) before the final disk disruption event. The system\ncould undergo repeated episodes of disk formation.

Observations, however, place the\nboundary close to 10% of the Eddington limit. We study the effect of\nrotationally induced transport processes on the stability of helium burning.\nFor the first time detailed calculations of thin helium shell burning on\nneutron stars are performed using a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code\nincluding rotation and rotationally induced magnetic fields. We find that in\nmost cases the instabilities from the magnetic field provide the dominant\ncontribution to the chemical mixing, while Eddington-Sweet circulations become\nimportant at high rotation rates. As helium is diffused to greater depths, the\nstability of the burning is increased, such that the critical accretion rate\nfor stable helium burning is found to be lower. Combined with a higher heat\nflux from the crust, as suggested by recent studies, turbulent mixing could\nexplain the observed critical accretion rate. Furthermore, close to this\nboundary we find oscillatory burning, which previous studies have linked to mHz\nQPOs.

The outburst\nmorphology is unusual for an AMXP, comprising two peaks, the second containing\na 'plateau' of ~ 10 days at maximum brightness within 30 days of the initial\nactivity. This has implications on duty cycles of short-period X-ray\ntransients. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted by a single, hard power-law. We\ndetect optical variability of ~ 0.05 magnitudes, on timescales of minutes, but\nfind no periodic modulation. In the optical, the SEDs contain a blue component,\nindicative of an irradiated disc, and a transient near-infrared (NIR) excess.\nThis excess is consistent with a simple model of an optically thick synchrotron\njet (as seen in other outbursting AMXPs). The optical spectrum shows a\ndouble-peaked H alpha profile, a diagnostic of an accretion disc, but we do not\nclearly see other lines (e.g. He I, II) reported in 2004.

These transitions between subclasses primarily\nmanifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in X-ray color-color\nand hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the kHz\nquasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/or\nX-ray spectra. We find that the low-energy X-ray flux is a good parameter to\ntrack the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensity\ndiagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detail\nthan before and relate the observed properties to other NS-LMXBs. We further\nfind that during the transition from Z to atoll, characteristic behavior known\nas the atoll upper banana can equivalently be described as the final stage of a\nweakening Z source flaring branch, thereby blurring the line between the two\nsubclasses.

XTE J1701-462 is the only example so\nfar of a source that during an outburst showed, beyond any doubt, spectral and\ntiming characteristics both of the Z and atoll type. We found that the lower\nkHz QPO in the atoll phase has a significantly higher coherence and fractional\nrms amplitude than any of the kHz QPOs seen during the Z phase, and that in the\nsame frequency range, atoll lower kHz QPOs show coherence and fractional rms\namplitude, respectively, 2 and 3 times larger than the Z kHz QPOs. Out of the\n707 observations in the Z phase, there is no single observation in which the\nkHz QPOs have a coherence or rms amplitude similar to those seen when XTE\nJ1701-462 was in the atoll phase, even though the total exposure time was about\n5 times longer in the Z than in the atoll phase. Since it is observed in the\nsame source, the difference in QPO coherence and rms amplitude between the Z\nand atoll phase cannot be due to neutron-star mass, magnetic field, spin,\ninclination of the accretion disk, etc. If the QPO frequency is a function of\nthe radius in the accretion disk in which it is produced, our results suggest\nthat in XTE J1701-462 the coherence and rms amplitude are not uniquely related\nto this radius. Here we argue that this difference is instead due to a change\nin the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star. Regardless of\nthe precise mechanism, our result shows that effects other than the geometry of\nspace time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the coherence and\nrms amplitude of the kHz QPOs, and therefore the coherence and rms amplitude of\nthe kHz QPOs cannot be simply used to deduce the existence of the innermost\nstable circular orbit around a neutron star.\n", "authors": "A.

Conclusion: Searches for\nweak pulsars with unknown pulse profile shapes in the Fermi-LAT, Agile or other\nX-ray data bases should benefit from the {\\it H-test} since it is known to be\npowerful against a broad range of pulse profiles, which introduces only a\nsingle statistical trial if only the {\\it H-test} is used. The new probability\ndistribution presented here favours the detection of weaker pulsars in terms of\nan improved sensitivity relative to the previously known distribution.\n", "authors": "O.

The simultaneous coverage at several wavelengths makes it\npossible to investigate in detail the broadband spectral energy distribution\n(SED) and the energetic of this source. The main results can be summarized as\nfollows. The ATCA reveals the presence of an extended radio emission in PKS\n0558-504 with two lobe-like structures at ~7\" from the bright central source.\nThe extended radio structure and the low value of the radio-loudness similar to\nradio-quiet Seyfert galaxies coupled with constraints from higher energy bands\nargue against a jet-dominated emission. The study of the SED, which is\ndominated by a nearly constant optical-UV emission, supports the conclusion\nthat PKS 0558-504 is accreting at super-Eddington rate. This conclusion was\nreached assuming M_BH=2.5e8 M_sun, which was obtained with a new scaling method\nbased on X-ray spectral variability results. A comparison between the accretion\nluminosity and the kinetic power associated with the jet suggests that in this\nsource the accretion power dominates in agreement with the results obtained\nfrom Radiation-MHD simulations of Galactic black holes (GBHs) accreting at the\nEddington rate. The combined findings from this panchromatic investigation\nstrongly suggest that PKS 0558-504 is a large-scale analog of GBHs in their\nhighly accreting intermediate state.

It determines the observational\nappearance of accretion flows, and is also related with the evolution of black\nhole mass and spin. Previous two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of hot\naccretion flows find that the flow is convectively unstable because of its\ninward increase of entropy. As a result, the mass accretion rate decreases\ninward, i.e., only a small fraction of accretion gas can fall onto the black\nhole, while the rest circulates in the convective eddies or lost in convective\noutflows. Radiation is usually neglected in these simulations. In many cases,\nhowever, radiative cooling is important. In the regime of the luminous hot\naccretion flow (LHAF), radiative cooling is even stronger than the viscous\ndissipation. In the one dimensional case, this implies that the inward increase\nof entropy will become slower or the entropy even decreases inward in the case\nof an LHAF.

In the latter case this is due\nto Photospheric Radius Expansion (PRE): when the flux reaches the Eddington\nlimit, the photosphere expands and cools so that emission becomes softer and\ndrops temporarily out of the X-ray band, re-appearing as the photosphere\nsettles back down. We consider the factors necessary to generate double-peaked\nPRE events, and show that such a mechanism could plausibly operate in magnetar\nbursts, despite the vastly different emission process. Identification of the\nmagnetic Eddington limit in a magnetar would constrain magnetic field and\ndistance and could, in principle, enable a measurement of gravitational\nredshift. It would also locate the emitting region at the neutron star surface,\nconstraining the burst trigger mechanism.

In the double detonation scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) a\ndetonation initiates in a shell of He-rich material accreted from a companion\nstar by a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass White Dwarf (WD). This shell detonation drives\na shock front into the carbon-oxygen (C/O) WD that triggers a secondary\ndetonation in the core. The core detonation results in a complete disruption of\nthe WD. Earlier studies concluded that this scenario has difficulties in\naccounting for the observed properties of SNe Ia since the explosion ejecta are\nsurrounded by the products of explosive He burning in the shell. Recently, it\nwas proposed that detonations might be possible for much less massive He shells\nthan previously assumed. Moreover, it was shown that even detonations of these\nminimum He shell masses robustly trigger detonations of the C/O core. Here we\npresent time-dependent multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations for\nmodels with minimum He shell mass and derive synthetic observables for both the\noptical and {\\gamma}-ray spectral regions. These differ strongly from those\nfound in earlier simulations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions in which more\nmassive He shells were considered. Our models predict light curves which cover\nboth the range of brightnesses and the rise and decline times of observed SNe\nIa. However, their colours and spectra do not match the observations. In\nparticular, their B-V colours are generally too red. We show that this\ndiscrepancy is mainly due to the composition of the burning products of the He\nshell of our models which contain significant amounts of Ti and Cr. Using a toy\nmodel, we also show that the burning products of the He shell depend crucially\non its initial composition. This leads us to conclude that good agreement\nbetween sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions and observed SNe Ia may still be\nfeasible but further study of the shell properties is required.\n", "authors": "M.

The source exhibits\ntwo distinct states: the hard state shows emission from 1 to 150 keV, while the\nsoft state is mostly confined to be $<40$ keV. We model soft-state continuum\nspectra with two thermal components, one of which is a multicolor accretion\ndisk and the other is a single-temperature blackbody to describe the boundary\nlayer, with additional weak Comptonization represented by either a simple power\nlaw or the SIMPL model by Steiner et al. The hard-state continuum spectra are\nmodeled by a single-temperature blackbody for the boundary layer plus strong\nComptonization, modeled by a cutoff power law. While we are unable to draw firm\nconclusions about the physical properties of the disk in the hard state, the\naccretion disk in the soft state appears to approximately follow $L\\propto\nT^{3.2}$. The deviation from $L\\propto T^4$, as expected from a constant inner\ndisk radius, might be caused by a luminosity-dependent spectral hardening\nfactor and/or real changes of the inner disk radius in some part of the soft\nstate. The boundary layer apparent emission area is roughly constant from the\nhard to the soft states, with a value of about 1/11 of the neutron star\nsurface. The magnetic field on the surface of the NS in 4U~1705--44 is\nestimated to be less than about $1.9\\times 10^8$ G, assuming that the disk is\ntruncated by the ISCO or by the neutron star surface. Broad relativistic Fe\nlines are detected in most spectra and are modeled with the diskline model. The\nstrength of the Fe lines is found to correlate well with the boundary layer\nemission in the soft state.

We find\nthat in the context of the external forward shock model, the only viable option\nto explain the X-ray and optical data of GRB 090920B is to have the electron\nenergy distribution deviate from a power-law shape and exhibit some slight\ncurvature immediately downstream of the shock front (we explored other models\nthat rely on a single power-law assumption, but they all fail to explain the\nobservations). We find the fraction of the energy of shocked plasma in magnetic\nfield to be ~10^{-6} using late time afterglow data, which is consistent with\nthe value obtained using early gamma-ray data. Studies like the present one\nmight be able to provide a link between GRB afterglow modeling and numerical\nsimulations of particle acceleration in collisionless shocks. We also provide\ndetailed calculations for the early (< 10^3 s) high energy (> 100 MeV) emission\nand confirm that it is consistent with origin in the external forward shock. We\ninvestigated the possibility that the ~10 keV excess observed in the spectrum\nduring the prompt phase also has its origin in the external shock and found the\nanswer to be negative.\n", "authors": "Rodolfo Barniol Duran, Pawan Kumar"}, {"category": "astro-ph.HE", "pubdate": "2011-07-07T09:39:41Z", "title": "The propagation of relativistic jets in external media", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1326v1", "summary": "  Relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that contain\ncompact objects.

The nature of the burning depends on the turbulent Damkohler\nnumber (Da), which steadily declines from much greater than one to less that\none as the density decreases to a few 10^6 g/cc. Scaling arguments predict that\nthe turbulent flame speed s, normalized by the turbulent intensity u, follows\ns/u=Da^1/2 for Da<1. The flame in this regime is a single turbulently-broadened\nstructure that moves at a steady speed, and has a width larger than the\nintegral scale of the turbulence. The scaling is predicted to break down at\nDa=1, and the flame burns as a turbulently-broadened effective unity Lewis\nnumber flame. We refer to this kind of flame as a lambda-flame. The burning\nbecomes a collection of lambda-flames spread over a region approximately the\nsize of the integral scale. While the total burning rate continues to have a\nwell-defined average, s_{T} ~ u, the burning is unsteady. We present a\ntheoretical framework, supported by both 1D and 3D numerical simulations, for\nthe burning in these two regimes. Our results indicate that the average value\nof s can actually be roughly twice u for Da>1, and that localized excursions to\nas much as five times u can occur. The lambda-flame speed and width can be\npredicted based on the turbulence in the star and the turbulent nuclear burning\ntime scale of the fuel. We propose a practical method for measuring these based\non the scaling relations and small-scale computationally-inexpensive\nsimulations.

We consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.\nthe pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between the\npulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting are\nneglected. The impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weak\nmagnetization (with magnetization parameter $\\sigma<0.1$), which is consistent\nwith conventional models of pulsar winds. The effects related to anisotropy in\npulsar winds are modeled assuming that the kinetic energy flux in a\nnon-magnetized pulsar wind is strongly anisotropic, with the minimum at the\npulsar rotation axis and the maximum in the perpendicular direction. We show\nthat, although both considered effects change the shape of the region occupied\nby the terminated pulsar wind, their impact appears to be small.

The metallicity (log(O/H)_PP04 + 12\n= 8.19) of the explosion site within the host galaxy places SN 2010ay in the\nlow-metallicity regime populated by GRB-SNe, and ~0.5(0.2) dex lower than that\ntypically measured for the host environments of normal (broad-lined) Ic\nsupernovae. We constrain any gamma-ray emission with E_gamma < 6x10^{48} erg\n(25-150 keV) and our deep radio follow-up observations with the Expanded Very\nLarge Array rule out relativistic ejecta with energy, E > 10^48 erg. We\ntherefore rule out the association of a relativistic outflow like those which\naccompanied SN 1998bw and traditional long-duration GRBs, but place\nless-stringent constraints on a weak afterglow like that seen from XRF 060218.\nThese observations challenge the importance of progenitor metallicity for the\nproduction of a GRB, and suggest that other parameters also play a key role.\n", "authors": "Nathan E.

New\nfitting formulae are presented for the inspiral time and the radiation-reaction\ntorque in the relativistic regime.

In this model the accreting\nmatter subsonically settles down onto the rotating magnetosphere forming an\nextended quasi-static shell. This shell mediates the angular momentum removal\nfrom the rotating neutron star magnetosphere during spin-down episodes by\nlarge-scale convective motions. The accretion rate through the shell is\ndetermined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere. The\nsettling regime of accretion can be realized for moderate accretion rates $\\dot\nM< \\dot M_*\\simeq 4\\times 10^{16}$ g/s. At higher accretion rates a free-fall\ngap above the neutron star magnetosphere appears due to rapid Compton cooling,\nand accretion becomes highly non-stationary. From observations of the\nspin-up/spin-down rates (the angular rotation frequency derivative $\\dot\n\\omega^*$, and $\\partial\\dot\\omega^*/\\partial\\dot M$ near the torque reversal)\nof X-ray pulsars with known orbital periods, it is possible to determine the\nmain dimensionless parameters of the model, as well as to estimate the magnetic\nfield of the neutron star.

This difference can be obtained only through a careful\ntreatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind.

The CSM is composed of the stellar wind\nmatter from the progenitor in its pre-supernova phase, and assumed to be\naxially symmetric: more matter around the equator than in the polar direction\ndriven by rotation of the progenitor. Because of high density of the CSM, the\nionization state of the shock-heated ejecta quickly becomes equilibrium with\nthe electron temperature. When the blast wave breaks out of the CSM into the\nrarefied ISM, the shocked ejecta cools rapidly due to adiabatic expansion, and\nhence an over-ionized/recombining plasma would be left. The ejecta is reheated\nby the second reverse shock due to the interaction with the ISM. We calculate\nthe emission measure of the supernova remnant (SNR) along the line of sight,\nand find that the over-ionized plasma appears to be bar-like with wings in the\nedge-on (equatorial view), while shell-like in the face-on (polar view)\ngeometry with respect to the rotation axis. The hot gas heated by the blast\nwave exists in the outermost region of the SNR with a nearly complete shell,\nbut the X-rays therefrom are too faint to be observable. Thus, depending on the\nviewing angle, the SNR of the over-ionized plasma would exhibit center-filled\nmorphology in X-rays, like W49B, a mixed-morphology SNR.

In this paper, key predictions of DSA at relativistic\nshocks that are germane to production of relativistic electrons and ions are\noutlined. The technique employed to identify these characteristics is a Monte\nCarlo simulation of such diffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic,\noblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks. Using a compact prescription for\ndiffusion of charges in MHD turbulence, this approach generates particle\nangular and momentum distributions at any position upstream or downstream of\nthe shock. Simulation output is presented for both small angle and large angle\nscattering scenarios, and a variety of shock obliquities including superluminal\nregimes when the de Hoffmann-Teller frame does not exist. The distribution\nfunction power-law indices compare favorably with results from other\ntechniques. They are found to depend sensitively on the mean magnetic field\norientation in the shock, and the nature of MHD turbulence that propagates\nalong fields in shock environs. An interesting regime of flat spectrum\ngeneration is addressed; we provide evidence for it being due to shock drift\nacceleration, a phenomenon well-known in heliospheric shock studies. The impact\nof these theoretical results on blazar science is outlined.

We interpret this diffuse X-ray emission component as being due to\ninverse-Compton up-scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons by\nultrarelativistic electrons within the lobe, with only a minor contribution\nfrom the beamed emission of the large-scale jet. Utilizing archival radio data\nfor the source, we demonstrate by means of broad-band spectral modeling that\nthe -ray flux of the Fermi-LAT source 2FGL J1629.4+8236 may well be accounted\nfor by the high-energy tail of the inverse-Compton continuum of the lobe. Thus,\nthis claimed association of gamma-rays from the north-west lobe of NGC6251,\ntogether with the recent Fermi-LAT imaging of the extended lobes of Centaurus\nA, indicates that particles may be efficiently (re-)accelerated up to\nultrarelativistic energies within extended radio lobes of nearby radio galaxies\nin general.\n", "authors": "Y.

The UV/optical\nflux from the nucleus was found to vary dramatically over the monitoring\nperiod, with a similar pattern of variation in each of the observed UV/optical\nbands (spanning 1900 - 5500 {\\AA}). In particular, the luminosity of NGC 4395\nin the 1900 {\\AA} band changed by more than a factor of eight over the\nmonitoring period. The fractional variability was smaller in the UV/optical\nbands than that seen in the X-rays, with the X-ray/optical ratio increasing\nwith increasing flux. Pseudo-instantaneous flux measurements in the X-ray and\neach UV/optical band were well correlated, with cross correlation coefficients\nof >0.7, significant at 99.9 per cent confidence. Archival Swift observations\nfrom 2006 sample the intra-day X-ray/optical variability on NGC 4395. These\narchival data show a very strong correlation between the X-ray and b bands,\nwith a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.84 (significant at >99 per cent\nconfidence). The peak in the cross correlation function is marginally resolved\nand asymmetric, suggesting that X-rays lead the b band, but by 1 hour. In\nresponse to recent (August 2011) very high X-ray flux levels from NGC4395 we\ntriggered Swift ToO observations, which sample the intra-hour X-ray/UV\nvariability. These observations indicate, albeit with large uncertainties, a\nlag of the 1900 {\\AA} band behind the X-ray flux of ~400 s. The tight\ncorrelation between the X-ray and UV/optical lightcurves, together with the\nconstraints we place on lag time-scale are consistent with the UV/optical\nvariability of NGC 4395 being primarily due to reprocessing of X-ray photons by\nthe accretion disc.\n", "authors": "D.

We do this using a set of XMM-Newton\nreference spectra of local galaxies for which we have accurate NH information,\nas described in Brightman & Nandra. The technique uses two rest-frame hardness\nratios which are optimised for this task, which we designate HR1 (2-4/1-2 keV)\nand HR2 (4-16/2-4 keV). The selection method exploits the fact that while\nobscured AGN appear hard in HR2 due to absorption of the intrinsic source flux\nbelow ~4 keV, they appear soft in HR1 due to excess emission originating from\nscattered source light, thermal emission, or host galaxy emission. Such\nemission is ubiquitous in low redshift samples. The technique offers a very\nsimple and straight forward way of estimating the fraction of obscured AGN in\nsamples with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio in the X-ray band. We apply\nthis technique to a moderate redshift (z~1) sample of AGN from the Chandra Deep\nField North, finding that 61% of this sample has NH> 10^23 cm^-2. A clear and\nrobust conclusion from our analysis, is that in deep surveys the vast majority\nof sources do not show hardness ratios consistent with a simple absorbed\npower-law. The ubiquity of complex spectra in turn shows that simple hardness\nratio analysis will not yield reliable obscuration estimates, justifying the\nmore complex colour-colour analysis described in this paper. While this method\ndoes very well at separating sources with NH> 10^23 cm^-2 from sources with\nlower NH, only X-ray spectroscopy can identify Compton thick sources, through\nthe detection of the Fe Ka line.

These two processes lead to exchange of energy and\nmomentum between charged and neutral particles both upstream and downstream of\nthe shock. In particular, neutrals that suffer a charge exchange downstream\nwith shock-heated ions generate high velocity neutrals that have a finite\nprobability of returning upstream. These neutrals might then deposit heat in\nthe upstream plasma through ionization and charge exchange, thereby reducing\nthe fluid Mach number. A consequence of this phenomenon, that we refer to as\nthe \"neutral return flux\", is a reduction of the shock compression factor and\nthe formation of a shock precursor upstream. The scale length of the precursor\nis determined by the ionization and charge exchange interaction lengths of fast\nneutrals moving towards upstream infinity. In the case of a shock propagating\nin the interstellar medium, the effects of ion-neutral interactions are\nespecially important for shock velocities < 3000 km/s. Such propagation\nvelocities are common among shocks associated with supernova remnants, the\nprimary candidate sources for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays.

We examine the relationship between the gamma-ray luminosity,\nL_psr_g, and Edot, which exhibits a smaller scatter compared to that in X-rays.\nThis confirms that the very large spread in the X-ray efficiencies cannot be\nexplained just by beaming because the gamma-ray emission is generally expected\nto be beamed stronger than the X-ray emission.

GX 339-4 was\nobserved at three different epochs, once in the soft state and twice in the\nhard state. In the soft state, the optical and near-infrared continuum is\nlargely consistent with the Raleigh-Jeans tail of a thermal process. As an\nexplanation, we favour irradiation of the outer accretion disc by its inner\nregions, enhanced by disc warping. An excess is also present at low\nfrequencies, likely due to a M subgiant companion star. During the first hard\nstate, the optical/near-infrared continuum is well-described by the optically\nthin synchrotron emission of the compact jet combined with disc irradiation and\nperhaps another component peaking in the ultraviolet. The spectral break where\nthe jet transits from the optically thick to thin regimes, located below\n1.20e14 Hz, is not detected and the extension of the optically thin synchrotron\nis consistent with the 3-50 keV spectrum. In contrast, the emission during the\nsecond hard state is more difficult to understand and points toward a more\ncomplex jet continuum. In both cases, the near-infrared continuum is found to\nbe variable at timescales at least as short as 20 s, although these\nvariabilities are smoothed out beyond a few hundred seconds. This implies rapid\nvariations - in flux and frequency - of the location of the spectral break,\ni.e. dramatic short timescale changes of the physical conditions at the base of\nthe jet, such as the magnetic field and/or the base radius.\n", "authors": "F.

Acceleration in reconnection sites has attracted the attention of\nresearchers recently. In this letter we analyze the energy distribution\nevolution of test particles injected in three dimensional (3D)\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of different magnetic reconnection\nconfigurations. When considering a single Sweet-Parker topology, the particles\naccelerate predominantly through a first-order Fermi process, as predicted in\nprevious work (de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian, 2005) and demonstrated\nnumerically in Kowal, de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian (2011). When turbulence is\nincluded within the current sheet, the acceleration rate, which depends on the\nreconnection rate, is highly enhanced. This is because reconnection in the\npresence of turbulence becomes fast and independent of resistivity (Lazarian &\nVishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009) and allows the formation of a thick volume\nfilled with multiple simultaneously reconnecting magnetic fluxes. Charged\nparticles trapped within this volume suffer several head-on scatterings with\nthe contracting magnetic fluctuations, which significantly increase the\nacceleration rate and results in a first-order Fermi process. For comparison,\nwe also tested acceleration in MHD turbulence, where particles suffer\ncollisions with approaching and receding magnetic irregularities, resulting in\na reduced acceleration rate. We argue that the dominant acceleration mechanism\napproaches a second order Fermi process in this case.\n", "authors": "Grzegorz Kowal, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino, Alex Lazarian"}, {"category": "astro-ph.HE", "pubdate": "2012-02-23T23:44:42Z", "title": "Anisotropy of Arrival Directions of E0 > 8 x 10**18 eV Cosmic Rays and\n  Cosmic Microwave Background", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5345v1", "summary": "  Results are presented that were obtained by analysing the arrival directions\nof E0 > 8x10**18 eV primary cosmic rays recorded at the Yakutsk array over the\nperiod between 1974 and 2003 and at the SUGAR array (Australia).

The key ingredient of\nthe model is the recent discovery that an isolated black hole can keep its open\nmagnetic flux for times much longer than the collapse time and, thus, can\nspin-down electromagnetically, driving the relativistic wind.\n  First, the merger is preceded by an electromagnetic precursor wind. If a\nfraction of the wind power is converted into pulsar-like coherent radio\nemission, this may produce an observable radio burst of few milliseconds.\n  At the active stage of the merger, two neutron stars produces a black hole\nsurrounded by an accretion torus in which the amplified magnetic field extracts\nthe rotational energy of the black hole and drives an axially-collimated\nelectromagnetic wind. For observers nearly aligned with the orbital normal this\nis seen as a classical short GRB.\n  After the accretion of the torus, the isolated black hole keeps the open\nmagnetic flux and drives the equatorially (not axially) collimated outflow,\nwhich is seen by an observer at intermediate polar angles as a prompt tail. The\ntail carries more energy than the prompt spike, but its emission is de-boosted\nfor observers along the orbital normal. Observers in the equatorial plane miss\nthe prompt spike and interpret the prompt tail as an energetic supernova-less\nlong GRB.\n  We also demonstrate that episodic accretion onto the BH of magnetized clouds\nthat carry non-zero magnetic flux can be highly efficient in extracting the\nspin energy of the BH, producing the outflows with the power exceeding the\naverage accretion power.\n", "authors": "Maxim Lyutikov"}, {"category": "astro-ph.HE", "pubdate": "2012-02-27T21:00:00Z", "title": "A Hybrid Magnetically/Thermally-Driven Wind in the Black Hole GRO\n  J1655-40?", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6053v1", "summary": "  During its 2005 outburst, GRO J1655-40 was observed twice with the Chandra\nHigh Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer; the second observation revealed\na spectrum rich with ionized absorption lines from elements ranging from O to\nNi (Miller et al. 2006a, 2008; Kallman et al. 2009), indicative of an outflow\ntoo dense and too ionized to be driven by radiation or thermal pressure.

Time-dependent\nbut not necessarily small perturbations of a Poynting-flux jet - possibly\ntriggered by a gas cloud penetrating the jet - are described by \"telegrapher's\nequations,\" which predict the propagation speed of disturbances and the\neffective wave impedance ${\\cal Z}$. The disturbance of a Poynting jet by the\ncloud gives rise to localized dissipation in the jet which may explain the\nenhanced synchrotron radiation in the knots of the 3C 303 jet, and in the\napparently stationary knot HST-1 in the jet from the nucleus of the galaxy M87\n(Biretta et al. 1999).\n", "authors": "R.

We present data\nfrom twice-weekly scans of the Galactic bulge by the Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer (RXTE) that allow us to compare the behaviour of known SFXTs and\npossible SFXT candidates with the persistently bright supergiant X-ray binary\n4U 1700-377. We independently confirm the orbital periods reported by other\ngroups for SFXTs SAX J1818.6-1703 and IGR J17544-2619.

The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility\nof significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.\nFive such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical\nafterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are\nsystematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst\ndensities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),\nor to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray\nfluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale\nenvironments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying\nhosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near\neach burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence\n(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10\",\nwhile somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with\nfaint galaxies at separations of ~2\". By measuring redshifts for the brighter\ngalaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of\n~30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z>1 leads to offsets of\n~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be\nexplained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two\npossibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the\ncenters of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due\nto the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and\nhave fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts.\n", "authors": "E.

In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by\none or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by\ninverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,\nthe linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission\nmodels, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy\nintegral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes\nsignificantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to\napply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed\nelectrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve\nthe differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of\nthe electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution. Since any non-linear\ncooling will turn into linear cooling after some time, we also calculated the\nelectron number density for a combined cooling scenario consisting of both the\nlinear and non-linear cooling. For all cases, we will also calculate\nanalytically the emerging optically thin synchrotron fluence spectrum which\nwill be compared to a numerical solution. For small normalized frequencies f <\n1 the fluence spectra show constant spectral indices. We find for linear\ncooling a_SYN = 1/2, and for non-linear cooling a_SSC = 3/2. In the combined\ncooling scenario we obtain for the small injection parameter b_1 = 1/2, and for\nthe large injection parameter b_2 = 3/2, which becomes b_1 = 1/2 for very small\nfrequencies, again.
