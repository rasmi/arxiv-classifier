Through\nanalysis of the kinematics and ionization state of a biconical outflow region\nemanating from the nucleus, we find that the outflow does not significantly\naccelerate the surrounding host-galaxy interstellar gas and is too weak to be a\nstrong ionization mechanism in the extended emission regions. Instead, the\nexcitation of the extended regions is consistent with photoionization by the\nactive nucleus. From energetics arguments we show that the nuclear outflow is\nslow and heavy and has a mechanical luminosity that is only ~1% of the\nestimated bolometric luminosity of the system. The energy in the outflow is\nable to mildly shape the gas in the extended regions but appears to be\ninsufficient to unbind it, or even to plausibly disrupt star formation. These\nresults are at odds with the picture of strong AGN feedback that has been\ninvoked to explain certain aspects of galaxy evolution.\n", "authors": "K. Schlesinger, Richard W.

The two components that we readily\nsee in edge-on Sb galaxies like NGC 4565 are a disk and a bar, but face-on SBb\ngalaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. Where is the\n(pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope K-band and\nSpitzer Space Telescope 3.6 um images to penetrate the dust in NGC 4565. We\nfind a high surface brightness, central stellar component, distinct from the\nboxy bar and from the galaxy's disk. Its minor-axis profile has a Sersic index\nof 1.33+/-0.12, so it is a pseudobulge. The pseudobulge has the smallest scale\nheight (~90 pc) of any component in the galaxy, in contrast to ~740 pc for the\nboxy bar plus thin disk. The disky pseudobulge is also much less luminous than\nthe boxy bar, so the true (pseudo)bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the galaxy\nis much less than previously thought. We infer that the pseudobulge-to-total\nluminosity ratios of edge-on galaxies with box-shaped bulges have generally\nbeen overestimated. Therefore more galaxies than we have recognized contain\nlittle or no evidence of a merger-built classical bulge. This challenges our\npicture of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering, because it is difficult\nto grow big galaxies without also making a big classical bulge. Solving the\npuzzle of the \"missing pseudobulge\" in NGC 4565 further increases our\nconfidence that we understand box-shaped bulges correctly as edge-on bars. This\nsupports our developing picture of the formation of pseudobulges -- both\nedge-on bars and disky central components -- by secular evolution in isolated\ngalaxies.\n", "authors": "John C.

This paper is the first of a series\nexamining the optical structure of M82's disk and inner wind; here we focus on\nthe ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevant\nemission line properties.\n  Our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of M82 is\ndynamically complex.

Following our recent work on the\norigins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clump\ninterface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulent\nmixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasingly\nimportant with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existence\nof mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area.\n", "authors": "M.

To quantify this role and facilitate comparisons with\nX-ray observations, we conduct 3D hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive\nmesh refinement code, FLASH, to investigate the physical properties of hot gas\ninside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our Galaxy or M31. We assume that\nthe dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanical\nenergy input from SNe, primarily Type Ia, and mass injection from evolved stars\nas well as iron enrichment from SNe. We study the bulge-wide outflow as well as\nthe SN heating on scales down to ~4 pc. An embedding scheme that is devised to\nplant individual SNR seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effect\nof sporadic SNe on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution of\nthe hot gas as well as the resultant X-ray morphology and spectrum. We find\nthat the SNe produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structures\nand patchy ejecta. Compared with a 1D spherical wind model, the non-uniformity\nof simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters the\nspectral shape and increases the diffuse X-ray luminosity. The differential\nemission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits a\nlog-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of the\ncorresponding 1D model. The bulk of the X-ray emission comes from the\nrelatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with SN\nblastwaves. SN ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least in\nthe bulge region.

They have a projected angular\nseparation of 5.7\", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To\nassess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and\nhave constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young\n(~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral\nfeatures, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides\nadditional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of\nM7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of\n~0.05 and ~0.015 M\\cdot according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and\nBaraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone\npassing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its\nspectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and\nB are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability\n(~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a\nprojected separation of a </- 6\". Barnard 215 contains only one other young\nstar and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first\nspectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather\nthan in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and\ncomprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not\nhave played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth\nof brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is\nincorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3\nand Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic\nerror. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B\nexhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nin Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This\ndiscrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects\nare now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model\nisochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5\ncould be roughly consistent with coevality.\n", "authors": "K. L. Luhman, E. E.

We have performed\nN-body simulations with and without a gaseous component. In the second case\nstar formation/feedback recipes have also been implemented to create new\nstellar populations. As in many previous studies, in our N-body collisionless\nsimulation, the B/PS is due to the classical break in the z mirror symmetry\nlasting roughly 200 Myr. When a gaseous component and star formation recipes\nare added to the simulation, the bulge-growing mechanism is quite different.\nThe young stellar population that is born in the thin gaseous disc rapidly\npopulates vertical resonant orbits triggered by the combined effects of the\nlinear horizontal and vertical ILRs. This leads to a B/PS bulge mainly made of\nstellar material younger than the surrounding population. The non-linear\nanalysis of the orbital structure shows that the main orbit family responsible\nfor the B/PS is not the same in the two cases. The 2:2:1 orbits prevail in the\ncollisionless simulation whereas additional asymmetrical families contribute to\nthe B/PS if a dissipative component is present and can form new stars. We found\nthat 2:3:1 and 2:5:1 orbits trap a significant fraction of the mass. A flat\nringed discy stellar component also appears simultaneously with the thickening\nof the young population.

In\nthis regime, large-scale turbulent compressions in the stable warm neutral\nmedium (WNM) dominate the clump-formation process rather than the linear\ndevelopent of TI. Cold clumps formed by this mechanism are often bounded by\nsharp density and temperature discontinuities, which however are not contact\ndiscontinuities as in the classical 2-phase model, but rather \"phase transition\nfronts\", across which there is net mass and momentum flux from the WNM into the\nclumps. The clumps grow mainly by accretion through their boundaries, are in\nboth thermal and ram pressure balance with their surroundings, and are\ninternally turbulent as well, thus also having significant density fluctuations\ninside. The temperature and density of the cold and warm gas around the phase\ntransition fronts fluctuate with time and location due to fluctuations in the\nturbulent pressure. Moreover, shock-compressed diffuse unstable gas can remain\nin the unstable regime for up to a few Myr before it undergoes a phase\ntransition to the cold phase. These processes populate the classically\nforbidden density and temperature ranges. Since gas at all temperatures appears\nto be present in bi- or tri-stable turbulence, we conclude that the word\n\"phase\" applies only locally, surrounding phase transition sites in the gas.\nGlobally, the word \"phase\" must relax its meaning to simply denote a certain\ntemperature or density range.\n", "authors": "Enrique Vazquez-Semadeni"}, {"category": "astro-ph.GA", "pubdate": "2009-02-05T08:29:01Z", "title": "A Study of Active Galactic Nuclei in Low Surface Brightness Galaxies\n  with Sloan Digital Sky Survey Spectroscopy", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0862v2", "summary": "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) in low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) have\nreceived little attention in previous studies.

The geometry considered\nis that of near static photoionized condensations at the surface of which\nturbulent mixing layers arise as a result of the interaction with the hot wind.\nThe approximative treatment of turbulence is carried out using the mixing\nlength approach of Canto & Raga.

A fast entraining wind of up to\n~4300km/s appears to be required to reproduce the faint wings of the broad\nH-alpha and [O III] profiles.

A well characterized sample\nof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass function\nof high-mass, star-forming clumps. This systematic survey at submm wavelengths\nalso represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA. The APEX telescope is\nideally located to observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer Camera\n(LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beam\nsize of 19\". Taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellent\nsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the Galactic Plane, with a noise\nlevel of 50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy\n(ATLASGAL). As a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. These data reveal 6000\ncompact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy, as well as extended structures, many of\nthem filamentary. About two thirds of the compact sources have no bright\ninfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to the\nprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources\nharbor hot cores, compact HII regions or young embedded clusters. Assuming a\ntypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc with\nmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 M_sun. In this introductory paper, we show\npreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss the\nperspectives of the survey.\n", "authors": "F. Schuller, K. M. Menten, Y. Contreras, F.

Here, we present the quiescent spectra. They\ncontain at least three components. The dominant component is the white dwarf\n(WD), which cools following the superoutburst. The amount of cooling depends\nsomewhat on the WD models used. For log g of 8.0, the temperature drops from\n24,000K just after the outburst to 20,000 K just before the normal outburst.\nFor this model, and a distance of 65 pc, the WD radius is ~8 x 10**8 cm and v\nsin(i) is ~420 km/s. The fact that the derived radius is smaller than expected\nfor a WD with log g=8 suggests a higher gravity WD or that VW Hyi is somewhat\nfurther than 65 pc. Either is possible given the current distance uncertainty\nof +-20 pc. Earlier suggestions that the WD photosphere shows evidence of CNO\nprocessed material are confirmed, but our analysis also shows that issues\nremain in terms of analyzing the spectra of WDs in such unusual physical\nsituations. The second component is relatively featureless and shows modulation\non the orbital (and just after outburst, the superhump) period. It is likely\nassociated with the hot spot where material from the secondary encounters the\ndisk, rather than the boundary layer region between the inner disk and WD. The\nsecond component fades ~10 days after the superoutburst. There is also a third\ncomponent, clearly visible in broad emission lines of C III 977, N III 991,\nLyman Beta and O VI 1032,1038, which appears to be accompanied by a flat\ncontinuum.

We analyze the\nspatial correlations between the position angles (PAs) of a selected sample of\nMCs (the largest clouds in the catalogue of the outer Galaxy published by Heyer\net al. 2001). Our results show that when the PAs of the clouds are all mapped\nto values into the [0,90]degrees interval, there is a significant degree of\nspatial correlation between the $PA$s on spatial scales in the range of 100-800\npc. These scales are of the order of the sizes of individual SN shells in low\ndensity environments such as those prevailing in the outer Galaxy and where the\nmetallicity of the ambient gas is of the order of the solar value or smaller.\nThese findings suggest that individual SN explosions, occurring in the outer\nregions of the Galaxy and in likewise spiral galaxies, albeit at lower rates,\ncontinue to play an important role in shaping the structure and dynamics of the\nISM in those regions. The SN explosions we postulate here are likely associated\nwith the existence of young stellar clusters in the far outer regions of the\nGalaxy and the UV emission and low levels of star formation observed with the\nGALEX satellite in the outer regions of local galaxies.\n", "authors": "Sami Dib, C.

We find that the mass function of the p-cores resembles the stellar IMF\nand the observed clump mass function, although p-core masses (~0.7 Msol) are\nsmaller than typical density clumps. The bound p-cores are generally subsonic,\nhave internal substructure, and are only quasi-spherical. We see no evidence of\nmassive bound cores supported by turbulence. We trace the evolution of the\np-cores forward in time, and investigate the connection between the original\np-core mass and the stellar mass that formed from it.

Both 2D and 3D\nClumpfind versions are tested, using 850 $\\mu$m dust emission and 13CO\nspectral-line observations of Perseus, respectively. The effect of varying\nthreshold is not important, but varying stepsize produces a different effect\nfor 2D and 3D cases. In the 2D case, where emission is relatively isolated\n(associated with only the densest peaks in the cloud), the mass spectrum\nvariability is negligible compared to the mass function fit uncertainties. In\nthe 3D case, however, where the 13CO emission traces the bulk of the molecular\ncloud, the number of clumps and the derived mass spectrum are highly correlated\nwith the stepsize used. The distinction between \"2D\" and \"3D\" here is more\nimportantly also a distinction between \"sparse\" and \"crowded\" emission. In any\n\"crowded\" case, Clumpfind should not be used blindly to derive mass functions.\nClumpfind's output in the \"crowded\" case can still offer a statistical\ndescription of emission useful in inter-comparisons, but the clump-list should\nnot be treated as a robust region decomposition suitable to generate a\nphysically-meaningful mass function.

A number of analyses have been carried out\nto investigate the dynamical behaviour and consequences of these discs,\nincluding disc thickness and eccentricity growth as well as mutual interaction\nand warping. However, most of these studies have neglected the influence of the\nstellar cusp surrounding the black hole, which is believed to be 1-2 orders of\nmagnitude more massive than the disc(s).\n  By means of N-body integrations using our bhint code, we study the impact of\nstellar cusps of different compositions. We find that although the presence of\na cusp does have an important effect on the evolution of an otherwise isolated\nflat disc, its influence on the evolution of disc thickness and warping is\nrather mild in a two-disc configuration. However, we show that the creation of\nhighly eccentric orbits strongly depends on the graininess of the cusp (i.e.\nthe mean and maximum stellar masses): While Chang (2009) recently found that\nfull cycles of Kozai resonance are prevented by the presence of an analytic\ncusp, we show that relaxation processes play an important role in such highly\ndense regions and support short-term resonances. We thus find that young disc\nstars on initially circular orbits can achieve high eccentricities by resonant\neffects also in the presence of a cusp of stellar remnants, yielding a\nmechanism to create S-stars and hyper-velocity stars.\n  Furthermore, we discuss the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the\nyoung stellar discs and find no definite evidence for a non-canonical IMF.\n", "authors": "Ulf L\u00f6ckmann, Holger Baumgardt, Pavel Kroupa"}, {"category": "astro-ph.GA", "pubdate": "2009-06-02T22:07:17Z", "title": "The Evolution of Gas Clouds Falling in the Magnetized Galactic Halo:\n  High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) Originated in the Galactic Fountain", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0613v1", "summary": "  In the Galactic fountain scenario, supernovae and/or stellar winds propel\nmaterial into the Galactic halo.

To do that, we investigated\ntwo possible causes for relaxing of the instantaneous mixing: i) the ``galactic\nfountain time delay effect'' and ii) the ``metal cooling time delay effect''.\nWe found that the effect of galactic fountains is negligible if an average time\ndelay of 0.1 Gyr, as suggested in a previous paper, is assumed. Longer time\ndelays produce differences in the results but they are not realistic. We also\nfound that the O abundance gradient in the disk is not affected by galactic\nfountains. The metal cooling time delays produce strong effects on the\nevolution of the chemical abundances only if we adopt stellar yields depending\non metallicity. If instead, the yields computed for to the solar chemical\ncomposition are adopted, negligible effects are produced, as in the case of the\ngalactic fountain delay. The relaxation of the IMA by means of the galactic\nfountain model, where the delay is considered only for massive stars and only\nin the disk, does not affect the chemical evolution results. The combination of\nmetal dependent yields and time delay in the chemical enrichment from all stars\nstarting from the halo phase, instead, produces results at variance with\nobservations.\n", "authors": "E.

Due to\nthe lack of submillimetric measurements the dust mass (M_{dust}) is only weakly\nconstrained by the infrared spectrum. We show that across the spiral-ring\nstructure of M31 a fraction >3% of the total dust mass is in PAHs. UV and\noptical colors are correlated to (TIR/FUV) ratios in \\sim 670 pc-sized regions\noverall the disk of M31, although deviating from the IRX-beta relationship for\nstarburst galaxies. We derived that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the\n10kpc ring more than 50% of the energy absorbed by the dust is rediated at\n\\lambda > 4000 \\AA and that dust in M31 appears mainly heated by populations a\nfew Gyr old even across the star-forming ring.

Within the uncertainties of our two-band\nphotometry, we find evidence of a radial variation in chemical enrichment, with\nthe SMC outskirts characterized by lower metallicity than the central zones.\n  From our CMDs we also infer that the SMC formed stars over a long interval of\ntime until ~2-3 Gyr ago. After a period of modest activity, star formation\nincreased again in the recent past, especially in the bar and the wing of the\nSMC, where we see an enhancement in the star-formation activity starting from\n~500 Myr ago. The inhomogeneous distribution of stars younger than ~100 Myr\nindicates that recent star formation has mainly developed locally.\n", "authors": "E. Sabbi, J. S. Gallagher, M. Tosi, J. Anderson, A.

We\nconsider the situation of converging, supersonic flows of warm neutral medium\nin the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstable\ngas in which clouds form. We found, as speculated in paper I, that in the\nshocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermal\ninstability grows in the isochorically cooling, thermally unstable slab that\nleads formation of HI clouds whose number density is typically n < 100 cm^-3,\neven if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small. We also\nfound that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field, evolution of\nthe shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean\nmagnetic field and converging flows. Thus, the direct formation of molecular\nclouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloud\nformation process, unless the direction of supersonic converging flows is\nbiased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism. However,\nwhen the angle is small, the HI shell generated as a result of converging flows\nis massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds, provided gas in the\nmassive HI shell is piled up again along the magnetic field line. We expect\nthat another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massive\nshell and produce a larger cloud.

The 21 photometrically confirmed type ab RRLs have mean [Fe/H]\n= -1.79 +/- 0.08, consistent with the abundances found for RRLs in a different\nportion of the Sgr tidal debris stream. The distribution of velocities in the\nGalactic standard of rest frame (V_GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not\nconsistent with a smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr\ndisruption models of Law et al (2005), a prominent group of five stars having\nhighly negative radial velocities (V_GSR ~ -175 kms-1) is consistent with\npredictions for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo is modeled as\noblate. The observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream\nhas a broader spread perpendicular to the Sgr plane than predicted by the\nmodels. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo Stellar\nStream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for RRLs in the\nregion with the same models, finding similarities in the velocity-position\ntrends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in the VSS region with\nlarge negative V_GSR values are likely to be old leading Sgr debris, but we\nfind that while old trailing Sgr debris may well make a contribution at\npositive V_GSR values, it is unlikely to fully account for the VSS feature.\nOverall we find that further modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally\nfavors oblate models while leading arm data favors prolate models, with no\nsingle potential fitting all the observed data.\n", "authors": "Sayuri L Prior, G S Da Costa, Stefan C Keller"}, {"category": "astro-ph.GA", "pubdate": "2009-09-09T09:17:03Z", "title": "Globular clusters in modified Newtonian dynamics: velocity-dispersion\n  profiles from self-consistent models", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1656v1", "summary": "  We test the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory with the\nvelocity-dispersion profiles of Galactic globular clusters populating the\noutermost region of the Milky Way halo, where the Galactic acceleration is\nlower than the characteristic MOND acceleration a_0.

We combine CaII and NaI absorption line measurements with HI 21-cm\nemission line data. For some of the sight lines high-resolution radio synthesis\nobservations were performed allowing us to study small-scale structures that\ncannot be resolved with single dish telescopes.\n  In total 177 lines of sight were observed, providing a large\nabsorption-selected data sample for the analysis of IVC and HVC gas in the\ncircumgalactic environment of the Milky Way. The study allows us to compare the\nobserved absorption column density distribution (CDD) of gas in the Milky Way\nhalo with the overall CDD of intervening absorbers towards quasars. The\nsensitive absorption line analysis enables us to identify the neutral and\nionised gaseous structures at low column densities and small angular extent\nthat possibly remain unseen in large 21-cm all-sky surveys. If this gas cover a\nsignificant portion of the sky, it possibly has a large influence on the\nevolution of the Milky Way.\n", "authors": "N. Ben Bekhti, P. Richter, M. T.

A numerical-chemical model has\nbeen developed which self-consistently follows the chemical evolution of a hot\ncore. The model comprises of two distinct stages. An initial collapse phase is\nimmediately followed by an increase in temperature which represents the switch\non of a central massive star and the subsequent evolution of the chemistry in a\nhot, dense gas cloud (the hot core). During the collapse phase, gas species are\nallowed to accrete on to grain surfaces where they can participate in further\nreactions. During the hot core phase surface species thermally desorb back in\nto the ambient gas and further chemical evolution takes place. For comparison,\nthe chemical network was also used to model a simple dark cloud and\nphotodissociation regions. Our investigation reveals that HNCO is inefficiently\nformed when only gas-phase formation pathways are considered in the chemical\nnetwork with reaction rates consistent with existing laboratory data. Using\ncurrently measured gas phase reaction rates, obtaining the observed HNCO\nabundances requires its formation on grain surfaces. However our model shows\nthat the gas phase HNCO in hot cores is not a simple direct product of the\nevaporation of grain mantles.

All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation measured at 20\nGHz, and most sources south of declination -15 deg also have near-simultaneous\nflux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected\nin polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies. We detect\na small but significant population of non-thermal sources that are either\nundetected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. We\nintroduce the term Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) to describe these radio\nsources, which have a spectral index alpha(5, 20) > +0.7 and which constitute\nroughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G sample. The 20 GHz flux densities measured\nfor the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year\nsource catalogue of Wright et al.

The parameters we vary are the Mach number of the inflow\nvelocity of the streams, Msinf, the rms Mach number of the initial background\nturbulence in the WNM, and the total mass contained in the colliding gas\nstreams, Minf. Because the SFE is a function of time, we define two estimators\nfor it, the \"absolute\" SFE, measured at t = 25 Myr into the simulation's\nevolution (sfeabs), and the \"relative\" SFE, measured 5 Myr after the onset of\nstar formation in each simulation (sferel). The latter is close to the \"star\nformation rate per free-fall time\" for gas at n = 100 cm^-3. We find that both\nestimators decrease with increasing Minf, although by no more than a factor of\n2 as Msinf increases from 1.25 to 3.5. Increasing levels of background\nturbulence similarly reduce the SFE, because the turbulence disrupts the\ncoherence of the colliding streams, fragmenting the cloud, and producing\nsmall-scale clumps scattered through the numerical box, which have low SFEs.\nFinally, the SFE is very sensitive to the mass of the inflows, with sferel\ndecreasing from ~0.4 to ~0.04 as the the virial parameter in the colliding\nstreams increases from ~0.15 to ~1.5.

Here, I present a\ncoherent, multiwavelength analysis of new and archival observations of the GC\nlobe. Radio continuum emission shows that the GC lobe has a magnetized layer\nwith a diameter of 110 pc and an equipartition field strength ranging from 40\nto 100 $\\mu$G.

Taken together, these results suggest that the AGN does\nnot play a significant role in driving the outflows in most infrared-faint and\ninfrared-bright systems, except the high-velocity outflows seen in Seyfert 1\ngalaxies. Another striking result of this study is the high rate of detection\nof inflows in infrared-faint galaxies (39% of Seyfert 1s, 35% of Seyfert 2s),\nsignificantly larger than in infrared-luminous Seyferts (15%). This inflow may\nbe contributing to the feeding of the AGN in these galaxies, and potentially\nprovides more than enough material to power the observed nuclear activity over\ntypical AGN lifetimes.\n", "authors": "Hannah B.

After applying the same criteria to older\nclusters (2-10 Myr), we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional\ndisks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when\ntheir star formation histories are properly taken into account.

We study the relationship between H2 and CO abundances\nusing a fully dynamical model of magnetized turbulence coupled to a chemical\nnetwork simplified to follow only the dominant pathways for H2 and CO formation\nand destruction, and including photodissociation using a six-ray approximation.\nWe find that the abundance of H2 is primarily determined by the amount of time\navailable for its formation, which is proportional to the product of the\ndensity and the metallicity, but insensitive to photodissociation.\nPhotodissociation only becomes important at extinctions under a few tenths of a\nvisual magnitude, in agreement with both observational and prior theoretical\nwork. On the other hand, CO forms quickly, within a dynamical time, but its\nabundance depends primarily on photodissociation, with only a weak secondary\ndependence on H2 abundance. As a result, there is a sharp cutoff in CO\nabundance at mean visual extinctions A_V < 3. At lower values of A_V we find\nthat the ratio of H2 column density to CO emissivity X_CO is proportional to\nA_V^(-3.5). This explains the discrepancy observed in low metallicity systems\nbetween cloud masses derived from CO observations and other techniques such as\ninfrared emission. Our work predicts that CO-bright clouds in low metallicity\nsystems should be systematically larger or denser than Milky Way clouds, or\nboth. Our results further explain the narrow range of observed molecular cloud\ncolumn densities as a threshold effect, without requiring the assumption of\nvirial equilibrium.\n", "authors": "S. C. O.

SiO, CO, and SO can all be a good tracer of the HH 211 jet,\ntracing the internal shocks in the jet. Although the emissions of these\nmolecules show roughly the same morphology of the jet, there are detailed\ndifferences. In particular, the CO emission traces the jet closer to the source\nthan the SiO and SO emissions. In addition, in the better resolved internal\nshocks, both the CO and SO emission are seen slightly ahead of the SiO\nemission. The jet is clearly seen on both sides of the source with more than\none cycle of wiggle. The wiggle is reflection-symmetric about the source and\ncan be reasonably fitted by an orbiting source jet model. The best-fit\nparameters suggest that the source itself could be a very low-mass protobinary\nwith a total mass of ~ 60 M_Jup and a binary separation of ~ 4.6 AU. The\nabundances of SiO and SO in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced in\nthe jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds, even close to within 300\nAU from the source where the dynamical time scale is <10 yrs. The abundance\nenhancements of these molecules are closely related to the internal shocks. The\ndetected SiO is either the consequence of the release of Si-bearing material\nfrom dust grains or of its formation via gas chemistry in the shocks.

It turns out that the angular momentum of the ionized\nstellar winds from orbiting stars in one or two disks orbiting Sgr A* could be\na critical factor in estimating accurately the accretion rate unto Sgr A*. A\nnet angular momentum of ionized gas feeding Sgr A* could lower the Bondi rate.\nFurthermore, the recent time delay picture of the peak flare emission can be\nunderstood in the context of adiabatic expansion of hot plasma. The expansion\nspeed of the plasma is estimated to be sub-relativistic. However, relativistic\nbulk motion of the plasma could lead to outflow from Sgr A*.

The larger is the mass, the smaller is\nthe Teff of the models, so that the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is\n\"horizontal\". In this paper we show that, if the helium mass fraction (Y) of\nthe envelope is larger than Y~0.5, the shape of the tracks changes completely:\nthe hydrogen burning becomes efficient again also for very small envelope\nmasses, thanks to the higher molecular weight and to the higher temperatures of\nthe hydrogen shell.

These tracks have a curled shape, are located\nat a Teff following the approximate relation Teff=8090+ 32900xY, and become\nmore luminous for larger envelope masses. Consequently, the ZAHB of the very\nhigh helium models is \"vertical\" in the HR diagram.

Consequently, this\ninterpretation implies that all these objects must in fact be progeny of the\nblue main sequence, but they have all suffered further deep mixing, that has\nlargely and uniformly increased their surface helium abundance, during the red\ngiant branch evolution.

In this work we explore the characterization\nof the turbulent cascade and its damping from observational spectral line\nprofiles. We address the difference of ion and neutral velocities by clarifying\nthe nature of the turbulence damping in the partially ionized. We provide\ntheoretical arguments in favor of the explanation of the larger Doppler\nbroadening of lines arising from neutral species compared to ions as arising\nfrom the turbulence damping of ions at larger scales. Also, we compute a number\nof MHD numerical simulations for different turbulent regimes and explicit\nturbulent damping, and compare both the 3-dimensional distributions of velocity\nand the synthetic line profile distributions. From the numerical simulations,\nwe place constraints on the precision with which one can measure the 3D\ndispersion depending on the turbulence sonic Mach number. We show that no\nuniversal correspondence between the 3D velocity dispersions measured in the\nturbulent volume and minima of the 2D velocity dispersions available through\nobservations exist. For instance, for subsonic turbulence the correspondence is\npoor at scales much smaller than the turbulence injection scale, while for\nsupersonic turbulence the correspondence is poor for the scales comparable with\nthe injection scale. We provide a physical explanation of the existence of such\na 2D-3D correspondence and discuss the uncertainties in evaluating the damping\nscale of ions that can be obtained from observations. However, we show that the\nstatistics of velocity dispersion from observed line profiles can provide the\nspectral index and the energy transfer rate of turbulence. Also, comparing two\nsimilar simulations with different viscous coefficients it was possible to\nconstrain the turbulent cut-off scale.

Further, using curvature radiation as the basic emission\nmechanism, we simulate the radio intensity profiles that would be observed from\na given distribution of emission regions, for different values of radio\nfrequency and Lorentz factor. We show clearly that rotation effects can\nintroduce significant asymmetries into the observed radio profiles. We\ninvestigate the dependency of profile features on various pulsar parameters. We\nfind that the radiation from a given ring of field lines can be seen over a\nlarge range of pulse longitudes, originating at different altitudes, with\nvarying spectral intensity. Preferred heights of emission along discrete sets\nof field lines are required to reproduce realistic pulsar profiles, and we\nillustrate this for a known pulsar.

Millimeter\ncontinuum emission indicates a mass of about 2 solar masses, both from a direct\ncalculation assuming isothermal dust and from dust radiative transfer models\nconstrained by the millimeter observations. We use dust radiative transfer\nmodels to constrain the internal luminosity of L673-7, defined to be the\nluminosity of the central source and excluding the luminosity from external\nheating, to be 0.01-0.045 solar luminosities, with 0.04 solar luminosities the\nmost likely value. L673-7 is thus classified as a very low luminosity object\n(VeLLO), and is among the lowest luminosity VeLLOs yet studied. We calculate\nthe kinematic and dynamic properties of the molecular outflow in the standard\nmanner, and we show that the expected accretion luminosity based on these\noutflow properties is greater than or equal to 0.36 solar luminosities. The\ndiscrepancy between this expected accretion luminosity and the internal\nluminosity derived from dust radiative transfer models indicates that the\ncurrent accretion rate is much lower than the average rate over the lifetime of\nthe outflow. Although the protostar embedded within L673-7 is consistent with\ncurrently being substellar, it is unlikely to remain as such given the\nsubstantial mass reservoir remaining in the core.\n", "authors": "Michael M.

This differs markedly from the canonical picture in\nwhich the Clouds travel on a quasi-periodic orbit about the MW (period of ~2\nGyr). Without a short period orbit about the MW, the origin of the Magellanic\nStream, a young (1-2 Gyr old) coherent stream of HI gas that trails the Clouds\n~150 degrees across the sky, can no longer be attributed to stripping by MW\ntides and/or ram pressure stripping by MW halo gas.

Taken all together, these 7 clusters support the claim that the\nvelocity dispersion is constant beyond r0, irrespectively of the specific\nphysical properties of the clusters: mass, size, dynamical history, and\ndistance from the Milky Way. The strong similarly with the constant velocity\ndispersion observed in elliptical galaxies beyond r0 is suggestive of a common\norigin for this phenomenon in the two class of objects, and might indicate a\nbreakdown of Newtonian dynamics below a0.\n", "authors": "R.

Extending earlier work, we show that\nwhen the abundances of Fe, alpha elements, and the r-process element Eu are\nconsidered, stars separate neatly into two groups that delineate the\ntraditional thin and thick disk of the Milky Way. The group akin to the thin\ndisk is traced by stars with [Fe/H]>-0.7 and alpha/Fe<0.2. The thick disk-like\ngroup overlaps the thin disk in [Fe/H] but has higher abundances of alpha\nelements and Eu. Stars in the range -1.5<[Fe/H]<-0.7 with low [alpha/Fe]\nratios, however, seem to belong to a separate, dynamically-cold, non-rotating\ncomponent that we associate with tidal debris. The kinematically-hot stellar\nhalo dominates the sample for [Fe/H]<-1.5. These results suggest that it may be\npossible to define the main dynamical components of the solar neighbourhood\nusing only their chemistry, an approach with a number of interesting\nconsequences. The kinematics of thin disk stars is then independent of\nmetallicity: their average rotation speed remains roughly constant in the range\n-0.7<[Fe/H]<+0.4, a result that argues against radial migration having played a\nsubstantial role in the evolution of the thin disk. The velocity dispersion of\nstars assigned to the thin disk is also independent of [Fe/H], implying that\nthe familiar increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing metallicity is the\nresult of the increased prevalence of the thick disk at lower metallicities,\nrather than of the sustained operation of a dynamical heating mechanism.

We observed the NH3(1,1) and (2,2), and the N2H+(3-2) lines towards\nthe submm peak positions. These data are used in conjunction with our LABOCA\n870 micron dust continuum data. The gas kinetic temperature in the cores is\nbetween ~9.4-13.9 K. The non-thermal velocity dispersion is subsonic in most of\nthe cores. The non-thermal linewidth in protostellar cores appears to increase\nwith increasing bolometric luminosity. The core masses are very likely drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution as the core masses in Orion B North. Starless\ncores in the region are likely to be gravitationally bound, and thus\nprestellar. Some of the cores have a lower radial velocity than the systemic\nvelocity of the region, suggesting that they are members of the \"low-velocity\npart\" of Orion B. The observed core-separation distances deviate from the\ncorresponding random-like model distributions. The distances between the\nnearest-neighbours are comparable to the thermal Jeans length. The fractional\nabundances of NH3 and N2H+ in the cores are ~1.5-9.8x10^{-8} and\n~0.2-5.9x10^{-10}, respectively. The NH3 abundance appears to decrease with\nincreasing H2 column and number densities. The NH3/N2H+ column density ratio is\nlarger in starless cores than in cores with embedded protostars. The core\npopulation in Orion B9 is comparable in physical properties to those in nearby\nlow-mass star-forming regions. It is unclear if the origin of cores could be\nexplained by turbulent fragmentation. On the other hand, many of the core\nproperties conform with the picture of dynamic core evolution. The Orion B9\nregion has probably been influenced by the feedback from the nearby Ori OB 1b\ngroup, and the fragmentation of the parental cloud into cores could be caused\nby gravitational instability.\n", "authors": "Oskari Miettinen, Jorma Harju, Lauri K.

We present ground-state NH3 absorption in seven distinct\nvelocity features along the line-of-sight towards Sgr B2.

We find no compelling\nevidence that the gradient differs between Peimbert Types I and II, nor is\noxygen abundance related to the vertical distance from the galactic plane. Our\ngradient agrees well with analogous results for H II regions but is steeper\nthan the one recently published by Stanghellini & Haywood (2010) over a similar\nrange in galactocentric distance. A second analysis using PN distances from a\ndifferent source implied a flatter gradient, and we suggest that we have\nreached a confusion limit which can only be resolved with greatly improved\ndistance measurements and an understanding of the natural scatter in oxygen\nabundances. Finally, a consideration of recently published chemical evolution\nmodels of the Galactic disk suggests that reconciling the current range in\npublished oxygen gradients is necessary for adequately constraining parameters\nsuch as the surface density threshold for star formation and the characteristic\ntimescale for disk formation.\n", "authors": "R.

The\ncompressions induce a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM) to form\ngrowing cold atomic clouds, which in their early stages may constitute thin CNM\nsheets. Several dynamical instabilities soon destabilize a cloud, rendering it\nturbulent.

However, before its global collapse is completed ($\\sim 10^7$\nyr later), the nonlinear density fluctuations within the cloud, which have\nshorter local free-fall times, collapse first and begin forming stars, a few\nMyr after the global contraction started. Large-scale fluctuations of lower\nmean densities collapse later, so the formation of massive star-forming regions\nis expected to occur late in the evolution of a large cloud complex, while\nscattered low-mass regions are expected to form earlier.

Results:\nMOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected\nso far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]\nratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This\nstar represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf\nstar in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log\ne(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo\ndwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results\nshow that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic\nbulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega\nCen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau\nis universal.\n", "authors": "T. Bensby, M. Asplund, J. A. Johnson, S.

These differences have led to the view that the\nthick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidence\nof the hierarchical growth of the Milky Way. We show here, using N-body\nsimulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellar\npopulations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internal\nevolution. In this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearly\ncircular orbits, as described by Sellwood & Binney (2002). As stars move\noutwards they populate a thickened component. Such stars found at the present\ntime in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smaller\nradii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to the\nproperties observed for thick disk stars. Classifying stars as members of the\nthin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent\nseparation in the other property as observed. This scenario is supported by the\nSDSS observation that stars in the transition region do not show any\ncorrelation between rotational velocity and metallicity. The good qualitative\nagreement between our simulation and observations in the Milky Way hint that\nthe thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellar\nmigration.

The model explaining this\nnew behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically cooling\nplasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background\nquiescent emission from Sgr A*. When a flare is launched, the plasma blob is\nmost compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emission\nin radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. Absorption in the observed\nlight curve of Sgr A* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects of\nlower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescent\nbrightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs.

We also investigate how a change of the $m_l$-limit influences\nmagnitudes and colours of clusters of a given mass and derive a necessary\ncondition for a luminosity and colour flash. The discreteness of the IMF leads\nto bursts in magnitude and colour of model clusters at moments when red\nsupergiants or giants appear and then die. The amplitude of the burst depends\non the cluster mass and on the spectral range; it is strongly increased in the\nNIR compared to optical passbands. In the discrete case, variations of the\nparameter $m_l$ are able to substantially change the magnitude-age and\n$M/L$-age relations. For the colours, the lowering of $m_l$ considerably\namplifies the discreteness effect. The influence of dynamical mass loss on\ncolour and magnitude is weak, although it provides a change of the slopes of\nthe considered relations, improving their agreement with observations. For the\nGalactic open clusters we determined luminosity and tidal mass independent of\neach other. The derived mass-to-luminosity ratio shows, on average, an increase\nwith cluster age in the optical, but gradually declines with age in the NIR.\nThe observed flash statistics can be used to constrain $m_l$ in open clusters.\n", "authors": "A.

The models successfully reproduce\nobserved continuum and polarization all-sky maps and the distribution of\nrotation measures of extragalactic sources across the sky. However, the model\nparameters obtained for the Galactic halo, although reproducing the\nobservations, seem physically unreasonable: the magnetic field needs to be\nsignificantly stronger in the Galactic halo than in the plane and the\ncosmic-ray distribution must be truncated at about 1 kpc to avoid excessive\nsynchrotron emission from the halo. The reason for these unrealistic parameters\nwas the low scale-height of the warm thermal gas of about 1 kpc adapted in the\nNE2001 model. However, this scale-height seemed well settled by numerous\ninvestigations. Recently, the scale-height of the warm gas in the Galaxy was\nrevised by Gaensler et al. (2008) to about 1.8 kpc, by showing that the 1 kpc\nscale-height results from a systematic bias in the analysis of pulsar data.\nThis implies a higher thermal electron density in the Galactic halo, which in\nturn reduces the halo magnetic field strength to account for the observed\nrotation measures of extragalactic sources. We slightly modified the NE2001\nmodel for the new scale-height and revised the Sun et al.

As a first step, we build on\nthe hypothesis of a volume density threshold for overall star formation and the\nmodel of Parmentier (2011) to establish the mass-radius relations of molecular\nclumps containing given masses of star-forming gas.

However, the combination of 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) and\nSpitzer-IRAC mid-infrared (MIR) photometry enables a powerful method for\ndetermining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengths\nlie in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most\nstars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsic\ncolor. Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening\nare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors\nand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their\nintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure\nstudies. In this paper we explore this \"Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess\" (RJCE)\nmethod and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method\nbased on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove\ndust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of\nstars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far\nsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods.

We address, through 2D\n(axisymmetric) simulations, the question of whether realistic levels of\nnonideal effects, computed with a simplified chemical network including dust\ngrains, can weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable a rotationally\nsupported disk to form. We find that ambipolar diffusion, the dominant nonideal\nMHD effect over most of the density range relevant to disk formation, does not\nenable disk formation, at least in 2D. The reason is that ambipolar diffusion\nallows the magnetic flux that would be dragged into the central stellar object\nin the ideal MHD limit to pile up instead in a small circumstellar region,\nwhere the magnetic field strength (and thus the braking efficiency) is greatly\nenhanced. We also find that, on the scale of tens of AU or more, a realistic\nlevel of Ohmic dissipation does not weaken the magnetic braking enough for a\nrotationally supported disk to form, either by itself or in combination with\nambipolar diffusion.

In this paper, we test the effects of\nthe integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) on the chemical evolution\nof the solar neighbourhood.

By taking into account also the fact that the\nmaximum achievable stellar mass is a function of the total mass of the cluster,\nthe IGIMF becomes a time-varying IMF which depends on the star formation rate.\nWe applied this formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solar\nneighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possible\nvalues for beta with the results obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,\nconstant IMF. In general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatter\nIGIMF, hence a larger number of massive stars and larger metal ejection rates.\nThis translates into higher type Ia and II supernova rates, higher mass\nejection rates from massive stars and a larger amount of gas available for star\nformation, coupled with lower present-day stellar mass densities.

The\ndifferent spatial and 3-D velocity distribution clearly indicate that the 22\nGHz water and 6.7 GHz methanol masers are tracing different kinematic\nenvironments. The bipolar distribution of 6.7 GHz maser l.o.s. velocities and\nthe regular pattern of observed proper motions suggest that these masers are\ntracing rotation around a central mass of about 35 solar masses. The flattened\nspatial distribution of the 6.7 GHz masers, oriented NW-SE, suggests that they\ncan originate in a disk/toroid rotating around the massive YSO which drives the\n12CO(2-1) outflow, oriented NE-SW, observed on arcsec scale. The extended,\nradio continuum source observed close to the 6.7 GHz masers could be excited by\na wide-angle wind emitted from the YSO associated with the methanol masers, and\nsuch a wind is proven to be sufficiently energetic to drive the NE-SW 12CO(2-1)\noutflow. The H2O masers distribute across a region offset about 0\".5 to the NW\nof the CH3OH masers, in the same area where emission of high-density molecular\ntracers, typical of HMCs, was detected.

This morphology is\ninteresting because it is generally accepted that a typical ring forms when\nmaterial collects near a resonance, set up by the pattern speed of a bar or\nbar-like perturbation. Our goal in this paper is to examine whether the ring\nstar formation properties are related to the non-axisymmetric gravity potential\nin general. For this purpose, we obtained H{\\alpha} emission line images and\ncalculated the line fluxes and star formation rates (SFRs) for 16 nonbarred SA\ngalaxies and four weakly barred SAB galaxies with rings. For comparison, we\ncombine our observations with a re-analysis of previously published data on\nfive SA, seven SAB, and 15 SB galaxies with rings, three of which are\nduplicates from our sample. With these data, we examine what role a bar may\nplay in the star formation process in rings. Compared to barred ringed\ngalaxies, we find that the inner ring SFRs and H{\\alpha}+[N ii] equivalent\nwidths in nonbarred ringed galaxies show a similar range and trend with\nabsolute blue magnitude, revised Hubble type, and other parameters. On the\nwhole, the star formation properties of inner rings, excluding the distribution\nof H ii regions, are independent of the ring shapes and the bar strength in our\nsmall samples. We confirm that the deprojected axis ratios of inner rings\ncorrelate with maximum relative gravitational force Q_g; however, if we\nconsider all rings, a better correlation is found when local bar forcing at the\nradius of the ring, Q_r, is used. Individual cases are described and other\ncorrelations are discussed. By studying the physical properties of these\ngalaxies, we hope to gain a better understanding of their placement in the\nscheme of the Hubble sequence and how they formed rings without the driving\nforce of a bar.\n", "authors": "R.

Water masers trace both a fast shock (up\nto 50 km/s) closer to the YSO, powered by a wide-angle wind, and a slower (20\nkm/s) bipolar jet, at the base of the large-scale outflow. Since the compact\nfree-free emission is found offset from the putative location of the YSO along\na direction consistent with that of the maser jet axis, we interpret the radio\ncontinuum in terms of a thermal jet.

The locus of the extrema of\nline--centroid-velocity increments (E-CVI) in that field follows this\nintense-shear structure as well as that of the 12CO(2-1) high-velocity line\nwings. The tiny spatial overlap in projection of the two parsec-scale\ncomponents implies that they are sheets of CO emission and that discontinuities\nin the gas properties (CO enrichment and/or increase of gas density) occur at\nthe position of the intense velocity shear. These results disclose spatial and\nkinematic coherence between scales as small as 0.03 pc and parsec scales. They\nconfirm that the departure from Gaussianity of the probability density\nfunctions of E-CVIs is a powerful statistical tracer of the intermittency of\nturbulence.

It is generally believed that these sub-clumps merge and form a\nyoung star cluster. The time-scale of this merging process is crucial for the\nevolution and the possible survival of the final star cluster. The key issue is\nwhether this merging process happens faster than the time needed to remove the\nresidual gas of the cloud. A merging time-scale shorter than the gas-removal\ntime would enhance the survival chances of the resulting star cluster. In this\npaper we show by means of numerical simulations that the time-scale of the\nmerging is indeed very fast. Depending on the details of the initial sub-clump\ndistribution, the merging may occur before the gas is expelled from the\nnewly-formed cluster either via supernovae or the winds from massive stars.

We utilize the rotation measure synthesis (RM-Synthesis) method,\nas implemented by Brentjens & de Bruyn, to coherently detect polarized emission\nfrom a large fractional bandwidth, while simultaneously assessing the degree of\nFaraday rotation experienced by the radiation along each line-of-sight. This\nrepresents the first time that the polarized emission and its Faraday rotation\nhave been systematically probed down to ~10 microJy/beam RMS for a large sample\nof galaxies. Non-zero Faraday rotation is found to be ubiquitous in all of the\ntarget fields, from both the Galactic foreground and the target galaxies\nthemselves. In this paper, we present an overview of the polarized emission\ndetected in each of the WSRT-SINGS galaxies. The most prominent trend is a\nsystematic modulation of the polarized intensity with galactic azimuth, such\nthat a global minimum in the polarized intensity is seen toward the\nkinematically receding major axis. The implied large-scale magnetic field\ngeometry is discussed in a companion paper. A second novel result is the\ndetection of multiple nuclear Faraday depth components that are offset to both\npositive and negative RM by 100-200 rad/m^2 in all targets that host polarized\n(circum-)nuclear emission.\n", "authors": "G.

In particular,\nwe focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy,\n2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed in\nthe host galaxy within the last Gyr, and 4) the X-ray luminosity of the hot\ndiffuse gas. As a result, we try to pin down the most successful range of\nmechanical feedback efficiencies. We find that while low feedback efficiencies\nresult in too much growth of the SMBH, high efficiencies totally blow out the\nhot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermal\nX-ray luminosity well below the observed range. The net lifetime of the quasar\nphase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between SMBH and its host galaxy,\nwhile the X-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formation\nwithin the last Gyr. When considering the popularly adopted model of the\nconstant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambient\nmedium should be more than 0.01% of the SMBH accretion energy to be consistent\nwith the SMBH mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe.

Aims: The observed abundances in planetary nebulae are compared\nto those predicted by the models of Karakas (2003) in order to predict the\nprogenitor masses of the various PNe used. The morphology of the PNe is\nincluded in the comparison. Since the central stars play an important role in\nthe evolution, it is expected that this comparison will yield additional\ninformation about them. Methods: First the nitrogen/oxygen ratio is discussed\nwith relation to the helium/hydrogen ratio. The progenitor mass for each PNe\ncan be found by a comparison with the models of Karakas. Then the present\nluminosity of the central stars is determined in two ways: first by computing\nthe central star effective temperature and radius, and second by computing the\nnebular luminosity from the hydrogen and helium lines. This luminosity is also\na function of the initial mass so that these two values of initial mass can be\ncompared. Results: Six of the seven bipolar nebulae can be identified as\ndescendants of high mass stars (4Msun - 6Msun) while the seventh is ambiguous.\nMost of the elliptical PNe have central stars which descend from low initial\nmass stars, although there are a few caveats which are discussed. There is no\nobservational evidence for a higher mass for central stars which have a high\ncarbon/oxygen ratio. The evidence provided by the abundance comparison with the\nmodels of Karakas is consistent with the HR diagram to which it is compared.

Therefore, it is important to correctly\nmodel the line formation of OH lines, especially in metal-poor stars, where 3D\nhydrodynamical models commonly predict cooler temperatures than plane-parallel\nhydrostatic models in the upper photosphere.

The recent measurements of large offsets (~100 km/s)\nbetween the heliocentric radial velocities of some very massive (O2-type) field\nstars and the systemic LMC velocity provides a possible explanation of this\nenigma and suggests that the field stars are runaway stars ejected from their\nbirth places at the very beginning of their parent cluster's dynamical\nevolution. A straightforward way to prove this explanation is to measure the\nproper motions of the field stars and to show that they are moving away from\none of the nearby star clusters or OB associations. This approach however is\ncomplicated by the large distance to the LMC, which makes accurate proper\nmotion measurements difficult. We use an alternative approach for solving the\nproblem, based on the search for bow shocks produced by runaway stars. The\ngeometry of detected bow shocks would allow us to infer the direction of\nstellar motion and thereby to determine their possible parent clusters. In this\npaper we present the results of a search for bow shocks around six massive\nfield stars which were suggested in the literature as candidate runaway stars.\nUsing archival (Spitzer Space Telescope) data, we found a bow shock associated\nwith one of our program stars, the O2 V((f*)) star BI 237, which is the\nfirst-ever detection of bow shocks in the LMC. Orientation of the bow shock\nsuggests that BI 237 was ejected from the OB association LH 82 (located at ~120\npc in projection from the star). A by-product of our search is the detection of\nbow shocks generated by four OB stars in the field of the LMC and an arc-like\nstructure attached to the candidate luminous blue variable R81 (HD 269128). The\ngeometry of two of these bow shocks is consistent with the possibility that\ntheir associated stars were ejected from the 30 Doradus star forming complex.\n", "authors": "V. V. Gvaramadze, P.

The symmetry axes of the\ntwo sources are aligned to within 5 degrees in the plane of the sky and the\ntips of their bow-shocks point towards Sgr A*. Our measurements show that the\nproper motion vectors of both features are pointing in directions more than 45\ndeg away from the line that connects them with Sgr A*. This misalignment of the\nbow-shock symmetry axes and their proper motion vectors, combined with the high\nproper motion velocities of several 100 km/s, suggest that the bow-shocks must\nbe produced by an interaction with some external fast wind, possibly coming\nfrom Sgr A*, or stars in its vicinity. We have developed a bow-shock model to\nfit the observed morphology and constrain the source of the external wind. The\nresult of our modeling allows us to estimate the velocity of the external wind,\nmaking sure that all likely stellar types of the bow-shock stars are\nconsidered. We show that neither of the two bow-shocks (one of which is clearly\nassociated with a stellar source) can be produced by influence of a stellar\nwind of a single mass-losing star in the central parsec. Instead, an outflow\ncarrying a momentum comparable to the one contributed by the ensemble of the\nmassive young stars, can drive shock velocities capable of producing the\nobserved cometary features. We argue that a collimated outflow arising\nperpendicular to the plane of the clockwise rotating stars (CWS), can easily\naccount for the two features and the mini-cavity. However, the collective wind\nfrom the CWS has a scale of >10''. The presence of a strong, mass-loaded\noutbound wind at projected distances from Sgr A* of <1'' is in fact in\nagreement with models that predict a highly inefficient accretion onto the\ncentral black hole due to a strongly radius dependent accretion flow.\n", "authors": "K.

Using millimetre surveys of\ndiscs within six local star-formation regions, we confirm this result, and find\nthat only a few percent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to\nbuild gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency\nof observed exo-planets is greater than this, there is a `missing mass'\nproblem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust-flux to\ndisc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets\ncould hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but\ntrends in multi-planet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical\nmodels suggest that the gas accretion timescale is too short for migration to\nsweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with\npredictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to\nmillimetre dust-flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the\nincidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the {\\it proto}stellar\nstages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via\ncore accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exo-planets.\nGravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the\nobjects have potentially unstable discs of $\\ga$30 % of the stellar mass.\nHowever, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 AU by\ninstability is unlikely, even in such massive discs.

Therefore, some cooling mechanism, for example\ndissipational effects of the interstellar medium, was assumed to be necessary\nto keep the spiral arms. Here we show that stellar disks can maintain spiral\nfeatures for several tens of rotations without the help of cooling, using a\nseries of high-resolution three-dimensional $N$-body simulations of pure\nstellar disks. We found that if the number of particles is sufficiently large,\ne.g., $3\\times 10^6$, multi-arm spirals developed in an isolated disk can\nsurvive for more than 10 Gyrs. We confirmed that there is a self-regulating\nmechanism that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms. Spiral arms increase\nToomre's $Q$ of the disk, and the heating rate correlates with the squared\namplitude of the spirals. Since the amplitude itself is limited by the value of\n$Q$, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of\nevolution. A simple analytical argument suggests that the heating is caused by\ngravitational scattering of stars by spiral arms, and that the self-regulating\nmechanism in pure-stellar disks can effectively maintain spiral arms on a\ncosmological timescale. In the case of a smaller number of particles, e.g.,\n$3\\times 10^5$, spiral arms grow faster in the beginning of the simulation\n(while $Q$ is small) and they cause a rapid increase of $Q$.

The ejecta is gradually and\ndynamically mixed with the medium at large galactic radii. The ejecta is also\nslowly diluted and cooled by {\\sl insitu} mass injection from evolved stars.\nThese processes together naturally result in the observed positive gradient in\nthe average radial iron abundance distribution of the hot gas, even if\nmass-weighted. This trend is in addition to the X-ray measurement bias that\ntends to underestimate the iron abundance for the hot gas with a temperature\ndistribution.\n", "authors": "Shikui Tang, Q.

The 95% upper limit for a gamma-ray flux enhancement in\npulsed emission phase window around all GPs is 4 times the average pulsed\ngamma-ray flux from the Crab. For the subset of IP GPs, the enhancement upper\nlimit, within the IP emission window, is 12 times the average pulsed gamma-ray\nflux. These results suggest that GPs, at least high-frequency IP GPs, are due\nto changes in coherence of radio emission rather than an overall increase in\nthe magnetospheric particle density.\n", "authors": "A.

The continuum-subtracted H_2 image is used to identify\noutflows. The data obtained in this study are used in conjunction with Spitzer,\nAKARI, and IRAS data. A parsec-scale bipolar outflow is discovered in our H_2\nline image, which is supported by the detection in the archival Spitzer images.\nThe H_2 image exhibits signs of precession of the main jet and shows tentative\nevidence for a second outflow. These suggest the possibility of a companion to\nthe outflow source. There is a strong component of continuum emission in the\ndirection of the outflow, which supports the idea that the outflow cavity\nprovides a path for radiation to escape, thereby reducing the radiation\npressure on the accreted matter. The bulk of the emission observed close to the\noutflow in the WFCAM and Spitzer bands is rotated counter clockwise with\nrespect to the outflow traced in H_2, which may be due to precession. The YSO\ndriving the outflow is identified in the Spitzer images. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the YSO is studied using available radiative transfer\nmodels. A model fit to the SED of the central source tells us that the YSO has\na mass of 12.23 M_sun and that it is in an early stage of evolution.\n", "authors": "Watson P.

The clouds are formed through gravitational fragmentation and structures\nwith densities n_H>=100cm^-3 are identified as GMCs. Between 1000-1500 clouds\nare created in the simulations with masses M > 10^5 Msolar and 180-240 with\nmasses M > 10^6 Msolar in agreement with estimates of the Milky Way's\npopulation. We find that the effect of photoelectric heating is to suppress the\nfragmentation of the ISM, resulting in a filamentary structure in the warm gas\nsurrounding clouds. This environment suppresses the formation of a retrograde\nrotating cloud population, with 88% of the clouds rotating prograde with\nrespect to the galaxy after 300 Myr. The diffuse heating also reduces the\ninitial star formation rate, slowing the conversation of gas into stars. We\ntherefore conclude that the interstellar environment plays an important role in\nthe GMCs evolution. Our clouds live between 0-20 Myr with a high infant\nmortality (t' < 3 Myr) due to cloud mergers and star formation. Other\nproperties, including distributions of mass, size and surface density agree\nwell with observations. Collisions between our clouds are common, occurring at\na rate of ~1/4 of the orbital period. It is not clear whether such collisions\ntrigger or suppress star formation at our current resolution. Our star\nformation rate is a factor of 10 higher than observations in local galaxies.\nThis is likely due to the absence of localized feedback in our models.\n", "authors": "Elizabeth J.

Yet the conditions in which they form and collapse are still not\nfully understood. In particular, the influence of the magnetic field on the\ncollapse of massive clumps is relatively unexplored, it is thus of great\nrelevance in the context of the formation of massive stars to investigate its\nimpact. We perform high resolution, MHD simulations of the collapse of hundred\nsolar masses, turbulent and magnetized clouds, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code RAMSES. We compute various quantities such as mass\ndistribution, magnetic field and angular momentum within the collapsing core\nand study the episodic outflows and the fragmentation that occurs during the\ncollapse. The magnetic field has a drastic impact on the cloud evolution. We\nfind that magnetic braking is able to substantially reduce the angular momentum\nin the inner part of the collapsing cloud. Fast and episodic outflows are being\nlaunched with typical velocities of the order of 3-5 km s$^{-1}$ although the\nhighest velocities can be as high as 30-40 km s$^{-1}$. The fragmentation in\nseveral objects, is reduced in substantially magnetized clouds with respect to\nhydrodynamical ones by a factor of the order of 1.5-2. We conclude that\nmagnetic fields have a significant impact on the evolution of massive clumps.\nIn combination with radiation, magnetic fields largely determine the outcome of\nmassive core collapse. We stress that numerical convergence of MHD collapse is\na challenging issue. In particular, numerical diffusion appears to be important\nat high density therefore possibly leading to an over-estimation of the number\nof fragments.\n", "authors": "P. Hennebelle, B.

Galactic dust emission for\nfields with average HI column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is well\ncorrelated with 21-cm emission. The residual emission in these fields, once the\nHI-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statistical\nproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. Fields with larger\ncolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the HI\ncolumn density. Regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest the\npresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlated\nwith CO emission. Dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detected\nwith high significance. Its spectral properties are consistent with, compared\nto the local ISM values, significantly hotter dust (T~20 K), lower\nsub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains to\nlarge grains about four times higher. These results are compatible with\nexpectations for clouds that are part of the Galactic fountain in which there\nis dust shattering and fragmentation. Correlated dust emission in HVCs is not\ndetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is\n0.15 times the local ISM value at 857 and 3000 GHz, in accordance with gas\nphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. Unexpected\nanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-section\nper H atom are identified in the local ISM and IVCs, a trend that continues\ninto molecular environments. This suggests that dust growth through\naggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloud\ncondensation and star formation processes.\n", "authors": " Planck Collaboration, A.

A\nset of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the collision\nbetween two cylindrical clouds are performed and compared to (sub)millimetre\nobservations of the Serpens Main Cluster. A configuration has been found which\nreproduces many of the observed characteristics of Serpens, including some of\nthe main features of the peculiar velocity field. The evolution of the velocity\nwith position throughout the model is similar to that observed and the column\ndensity and masses within the modeled cloud agree with those measured for the\nSE sub-cluster. Furthermore, our results also show that an asymmetric collision\nprovides the ingredients to reproduce lower density filaments perpendicular to\nthe main structure, similar to those observed. In this scenario, the formation\nof the NW sub-cluster of Serpens can be reproduced only if there is a\npre-existing marginally gravitationally unstable region at the time the\ncollision occurs. This work supports the interpretation that a collision\nbetween two clouds may have been the trigger of the most recent burst of star\nformation in Serpens.

The authors of\nthe discovery paper speculated on whether this object could reside in its own\ndark matter halo and/or if it might have formed through the merging of two or\nmore star clusters. In this paper, we present N-body simulations to explore\nthoroughly this particular formation scenario. We follow the merger of two star\nclusters within dark matter haloes of a range of masses (as well as in the\nabsence of a dark matter halo). In order to obtain a remnant which resembles\nthe observed extended star cluster, we find that the star formation efficiency\nhas to be quite high (around 33 per cent) and the dark matter halo, if present\nat all, has to be of very low mass, i.e. raising the mass to light ratio of the\nobject within the body of the stellar distribution by at most a factor of a\nfew. We also find that expansion of a single star cluster following mass loss\nprovides another viable formation path. Finally, we show that future\nmeasurements of the velocity dispersion of this system may be able to\ndistinguish between the various scenarios we have explored.\n", "authors": "Paulina Assmann, Mark I.

The\nB field does not significantly brake the HII region expansion on the length and\ntimescales accessible to our simulations, but it does tend to suppress the\nsmall-scale fragmentation and radiation-driven implosion of neutral/molecular\ngas that forms globules and pillars at the edge of the HII region. However, the\nrelative luminosity of ionising and non-ionising radiation has a much larger\ninfluence than the presence or absence of the B field. When the radiation field\nis relatively soft (as in the case of a lower mass cluster, with earliest\nspectral type of B0.5), then fragmentation is less vigorous and a thick,\nrelatively smooth PDR forms.

In this scenario\nUV upturn should be restricted to brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) only. This\nis a clear and testable prediction. We present tests of this hypothesis using\ngalaxy clusters from Yoon et al.

The data reveal a modest positive dependence of the\nUV upturn fraction on galaxy velocity dispersion, which is in agreement with\nthe earlier findings of Burstein et al.

We aim to understand\nhow dense cores form out of the less dense cloud material by studying the\nconnection between these two regimes. Methods. We observed the L1517 dark cloud\nin C18O(1-0), N2H+(1-0), and SO(JN=32-21) with the FCRAO 14m telescope, and in\nthe 1.2mm dust continuum with the IRAM 30m telescope. Results. Most of the gas\nin the cloud lies in four filaments that have typical lengths of 0.5 pc. Five\nstarless cores are embedded in these filaments and have chemical compositions\nindicative of different evolutionary stages. The filaments have radial profiles\nof C18O(1-0) emission with a central flattened region and a power-law tail, and\ncan be fitted approximately as isothermal, pressure-supported cylinders. The\nfilaments, in addition, are extremely quiescent. They have subsonic internal\nmotions and are coherent in velocity over their whole length. The large-scale\nmotions in the filaments can be used to predict the velocity inside the cores,\nindicating that core formation has not decoupled the dense gas kinematically\nfrom its parental material. In two filaments, these large-scale motions consist\nof oscillations in the velocity centroid, and a simple kinematic model suggests\nthat they may be related to core-forming flows. Conclusions. Core formation in\nL1517 seems to have occurred in two steps. First, the subsonic,\nvelocity-coherent filaments have condensed out of the more turbulent ambient\ncloud. Then, the cores fragmented quasi-statically and inherited the kinematics\nof the filaments. Turbulence dissipation has therefore occurred mostly on\nscales on the order of 0.5 pc or larger, and seems to have played a small role\nin the formation of the individual cores.\n", "authors": "A.

Recently, new parallax measurements of RXJ1856 and RXJ0720 were\nobtained. Considering that NSs may originate from binary systems that got\ndisrupted due to an asymmetric supernova, we attempt to identify runaway stars\nwhich may have been former companions to the NS progenitors. Such an\nidentification would strongly support a particular birth scenario with time and\nplace. We trace back each NS, runaway star and the centres of possible birth\nassociations to find close encounters. The kinematic age is then given by the\ntime since the encounter. We use Monte Carlo simulations to account for\nobservational uncertainties. Using the most recent parallax measurement of\n8.16+/-0.80 mas for RXJ1856, we find that it originated in the U Sco\nassociation 0.46+/-0.05 Myr ago. This is slightly larger than the value we\nreported earlier (0.3 Myr). Our result is strongly supported by its current\nradial velocity that we predict to be 6+19-20 km/s. This implies an inclination\nangle of 88+/-6 deg consistent with the bow shock. No suitable runaway star was\nfound to be a potential former companion of RXJ1856. Making use of a recent\nparallax measurement for RXJ0720 of 3.6+/-1.6 mas, we find that this NS was\npossibly born in Tr 10 0.85+/-0.15 Myr ago.

The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is\n100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass\nprotostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass\nsample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component\nof CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with\nH2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN and CH3OH vary by factors\n2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO,\nconsistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels\nof ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward\ndifferent types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping,\nanalysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on\nthe analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of\natoms, which results in a H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO\nfreezes out and variations in CO freeze-out levels and the subsequent CO-based\nchemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last\nimportant ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars,\nresulting in CO desorption, ice segregation and formation of complex organic\nmolecules.

Aims: We make an attempt to\ndetermine initial conditions of the Hyades cluster at the time of its formation\nin order to reproduce the present-day cumulative mass profile, stellar mass and\nluminosity function (LF). Methods: We performed direct $N$-body simulations of\nthe Hyades in an analytic Milky Way potential that account for stellar\nevolution and include primordial binaries in a few models. Furthermore, we\napplied a Kroupa (2001) IMF and used extensive ensemble-averaging. Results: We\nfind that evolved single-star King initial models with King parameters $W_0 =\n6-9$ and initial particle numbers $N_0 = 3000$ provide good fits to the\nobservational present-day cumulative mass profile within the Jacobi radius. The\nbest-fit King model has an initial mass of $1721\\ M_\\odot$ and an average mass\nloss rate of $-2.2 \\ M_\\odot/\\mathrm{Myr}$. The K-band LFs of models and\nobservations show a reasonable agreement. Mass segregation is detected in both\nobservations and models. If 33% primordial binaries are included the initial\nparticle number is reduced by 5% as compared to the model without primordial\nbinaries. Conclusions: The present-day properties of the Hyades can be well\nreproduced by a standard King or Plummer initial model when choosing\nappropriate initial conditions. The degeneracy of good-fitting models can be\nquite high due to the large dimension of the parameter space. More simulations\nwith different Roche-lobe filling factors and primordial binary fractions are\nrequired to explore this degeneracy in more detail.\n", "authors": "A. Ernst, A. Just, P. Berczik, C.

It builds upon the fact that, in the presence of far UV\nradiation and hydrocarbon grains, the hydrogen gas will be partially\ndissociated and the grain surface will be partially hydrogenated and partially\ncovered with free carbon bonds. Under such a statistical equilibrium, H atoms\nfrom the gas will recombine with C atoms at the grain surface at some rate. At\neach recombination, the H atom deposits an energy of about 5 eV in the grain.\nHalf of this is directly converted into vibrational excitation, always\ndistributed in the same way among the most tightly coupled vibration modes of\nthe grain. Absent frequent grain-grain collisions, the only outlet for this\nenergy is IR reemission, part of it in the UIBs, provided the chemical\nstructure of the grains is adequate, and the other part in the continuum. The\npartition only depends upon the grain size, all grains being assumed to have\nthe same constitution. Only a fraction, about 0.25, of the grains (among the\nsmallest ones) will contribute significantly to the UIBs.\n  It is shown quantitatively that H impacts are generally more efficient\nexcitation agents than UV absorption because of the overwhelming abundance of\nhydrogen relative to UV photons. Only very close to young bright stars is this\nno longer true because photon flux then largely exceeds H atom flux. Thus H\nimpacts and FUV absorption are both necessary to understand the variety of\nobserved UIB spectra.\n  The model translates into a small number of equations enabling a quantitative\ncomparison of its predictions with available astronomical observations, which\nhave become exquisitely rich and accurate in the last two decades.\n", "authors": "Renaud Papoular"}, {"category": "astro-ph.GA", "pubdate": "2011-10-07T08:21:44Z", "title": "AMI observations of unmatched Planck ERCSC LFI sources at 15.75 GHz", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1454v2", "summary": "  The Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue includes 26 sources with no\nobvious matches in other radio catalogues (of primarily extragalactic sources).\nHere we present observations made with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Small\nArray (AMI SA) at 15.75 GHz of the eight of the unmatched sources at\ndeclination > +10 degrees.

Here we\nundertake a critical evaluation of what is currently a popular method for\nprescribing cooling in SPH simulations, i.e. the polytropic cooling due\noriginally to Stamatellos et al. This method uses the local density and\npotential to estimate the column density and optical depth to each particle and\nthen uses these quantities to evaluate an approximate expression for the net\nradiative cooling. We evaluate the algorithm by considering both spherical and\ndisc-like systems with analytic density and temperature structures. In\nspherical systems, the total cooling rate computed by the method is within\naround 20 for the astrophysically relevant case of opacity dominated by ice\ngrains and is correct to within a factor of order unity for a range of opacity\nlaws. In disc geometry, however, the method systematically under-estimates the\ncooling by a large factor at all heights in the disc. For the self-gravitating\ndisc studied, we find that the method under-estimates the total cooling rate by\na factor of 200. This discrepancy may be readily traced to the method's\nsystematic over-estimate of the disc column density and optical depth, since\n(being based only on the local density and potential) it does not take into\naccount the low column density route for photon escape normal to the disc\nplane. These results raise an obvious caution about the method's use in disc\ngeometry whenever an accurate cooling rate is required, although we note that\nthere are situations where the discrepancies highlighted above may not\nsignificantly affect the global outcome of simulations.

We compare our measurements with the abundance ratios\nof inner and other outer halo GCs, halo field stars, GCs of recognized\nextragalactic origin, and stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). The\nabundance pattern of Pal 14 is almost identical to those of Pal 3 and Pal 4,\nthe next distant members of the outer halo GC population after Pal 14. The\nabundance pattern of Pal 14 is also similar to those of the inner halo GCs,\nhalo field stars, and GCs of recognized extragalactic origin, but differs from\nwhat is customarily found in dSphs field stars. The abundance properties of Pal\n14 as well as those of the other outer halo GCs are thus compatible with an\naccretion origin from dSphs.

The critical number of stars at which gravothermal oscillations first\nappeared is found using a gas code. The nature of the oscillations is\ninvestigated and it is shown that the oscillations can be understood by\nfocusing on the behaviour of the heavier component, because of mass\nsegregation. It is argued that, during each oscillation, the re-collapse of the\ncluster begins at larger radii while the core is still expanding. This\nre-collapse can halt and reverse a gravothermally driven expansion. This\nmaterial outside the core contracts because it is losing energy both to the\ncool expanding core and to the material at larger radii. The core collapse\ntimes for each model are also found and discussed. For an appropriately chosen\ncase, direct N -body runs were carried out, in order to check the results\nobtained from the gas model, including evidence of the gravothermal nature of\nthe oscillations and the temperature inversion that drives the expansion.\n", "authors": "Philip G.

In protoplanetary disks, different\nsnowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbon\nmonoxide, will result in systematic variations in the C/O ratio both in the gas\nand in the condensed phase.

In particular, we aim to\ninvestigate the kinematics and dynamical state of the cloud and clumps within\nit, and the amount of CO depletion. All the submillimetre peak positions in the\ncloud identified from our previous LABOCA 870-micron map were observed in\nC17O(2-1) with APEX. Selected positions were also observed in the 13CO(2-1),\nSiO(5-4), and CH3OH(5_k-4_k) transitions at ~1 mm wavelength. The C17O lines\nwere detected towards all target positions at similar radial velocities,\nindicating that G304.74 is a coherent filamentary structure. CO does not appear\nto be significantly depleted in the clumps. Two- to three methanol 5_k-4_k\nlines near ~241.8 GHz were detected towards all selected target positions,\nwhereas SiO(5-4) was seen in only one of these positions. The 13CO(2-1) lines\nshow blue asymmetric profiles, indicating large-scale infall motions. The\nclumps show trans- to supersonic non-thermal motions, and virial-parameter\nanalysis suggests that most of them are gravitationally bound. The external\npressure may also play a non-negligible role in the dynamics. This is\nqualitatively consistent with our earlier suggestion that the filament was\nformed by converging supersonic turbulent flows. The analysis suggests that the\nfragmentation of the filament into clumps is caused by \"sausage\"-type\ninstability, in agreement with results from other IRDCs. The star-formation\nactivity in the cloud, such as outflows, is likely responsible in releasing CO\nfrom the icy grain mantles back into the gas phase. Shocks related to outflows\nmay have also injected CH3OH, SiO, and DCN into the gas-phase in SMM 3.\n", "authors": "Oskari Miettinen"}, {"category": "astro-ph.GA", "pubdate": "2012-02-14T15:55:24Z", "title": "Formaldehyde and methanol deuteration in protostars: fossiles from a\n  past fast high density pre-collapse phase", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3073v2", "summary": "  Extremely high deuteration of several molecules have been observed around low\nmass protostars since a decade.

A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation\nradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may\nplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation\nwind that forms the cloud at every orbit.

The\ncluster models have different initial masses, different orbits, including\nelliptical ones, and different initial density profiles. We use two sets of\ncluster models: initially Roche-lobe filling and Roche-lobe underfilling. We\nidentify four distinct mass loss effects: (1) mass loss by stellar evolution,\n(2) loss of stars induced by stellar evolution and (3) relaxation-driven mass\nloss before and (4) after core collapse. Both the evolution-induced loss of\nstars and the relaxation-driven mass loss need time to build up. This is\ndescribed by a delay-function of a few crossing times for Roche-lobe filling\nclusters and a few half mass relaxation times for Roche-lobe underfilling\nclusters. The relaxation-driven mass loss can be described by a simple power\nlaw dependence of the mass dM/dt =-M^{1-gamma}/t0, (with M in Msun) where t0\ndepends on the orbit and environment of the cluster. Gamma is 0.65 for clusters\nwith a King-parameter W0=5 and 0.80 for more concentrated clusters with W0=7.\nFor initially Roche-lobe underfilling clusters the dissolution is described by\nthe same gamma=0.80. The values of the constant t0 are described by simple\nformulae that depend on the orbit of the cluster. The mass loss rate increases\nby about a factor two at core collapse and the mass dependence of the\nrelaxation-driven mass loss changes to gamma=0.70 after core collapse. We also\npresent a simple recipe for predicting the mass evolution of individual star\nclusters with various metallicities and in different environments, with an\naccuracy of a few percent in most cases.

This is different from elliptical galaxies, for\nwhich the Faber-Jackson relation suggests a strong positive correlation between\nmass and radius. Objects that are somewhat in between globular clusters and\nlow-mass galaxies, such as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, have a mass-radius\nrelation consistent with the extension of the relation for bright ellipticals.\nHere we show that at an age of 10 Gyr a break in the mass-radius relation at\n~10^6 Msun is established because objects below this mass, i.e. globular\nclusters, have undergone expansion driven by stellar evolution and hard\nbinaries. From numerical simulations we find that the combined energy\nproduction of these two effects in the core comes into balance with the flux of\nenergy that is conducted across the half-mass radius by relaxation. An\nimportant property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass\nradius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of\nbound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial\nmass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that the\npresent day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar\nsystems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters\nhave moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and\ndynamical evolution.\n", "authors": "Mark Gieles, Holger Baumgardt, Douglas Heggie, Henny Lamers"}, {"category": "astro-ph.GA", "pubdate": "2010-07-14T14:24:59Z", "title": "Fast rotating Blue Stragglers in the globular cluster M4", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2343v1", "summary": "  We have used high resolution spectra obtained with the spectrograph FLAMES at\nthe ESO Very Large Telescope to determine the kinematical properties and the\nabundance patterns of 20 blue straggler stars (BSSs) in the globular cluster\nM4.

We therefore argue that to constrain the\nrelative locations of the TFRs of spiral and S0 galaxies, the same tracer and\nmeasure must be used for both samples. Using detailed near-infrared imaging and\nthe circular velocities of axisymmetric Jeans models of 14 nearby edge-on Sa-Sb\nspirals and 14 nearby edge-on S0s drawn from a range of environments, we find\nthat S0s lie on a TFR with the same slope as the spirals, but are on average\n0.53+/-0.15 mag fainter at Ks-band at a given rotational velocity. This is a\nsignificantly smaller offset than that measured in earlier studies of the S0\nTFR, which we attribute to our elimination of the bias associated with using\ndifferent rotation measures and our use of earlier type spirals as a reference.\nSince our measurement of the offset avoids systematic biases, it should be\npreferred to previous estimates. A spiral stellar population in which star\nformation is truncated would take ~1 Gyr to fade by 0.53 mag at Ks-band. If S0s\nare the products of a simple truncation of star formation in spirals, then this\nfinding is difficult to reconcile with the observed evolution of the spiral/S0\nfraction with redshift. Recent star formation could explain the observed lack\nof fading in S0s, but the offset of the S0 TFR persists as a function of both\nstellar and dynamical mass. We show that the offset of the S0 TFR could\ntherefore be explained by a systematic difference between the total mass\ndistributions of S0s and spirals, in the sense that S0s need to be smaller or\nmore concentrated than spirals.\n", "authors": "Michael J.

We find two regions where our analysis\nsuggests high densities >10e5 cm^-3 and strong FUV fields (CHI=10e4-10e6),\nlikely associated with massive star formation.

Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength radio\ncontinuum data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we image\nIRAS 16353-4636 and its environment from 1.4 to 19.6 GHz, and derive the\ndistribution of the spectral index at maximum angular resolution.

Star formation occurs in very dense, cold,\nself-gravitating clouds. Turbulence, driven by momentum feedback from supernova\nevents, destroys bound clouds and puffs up the disk vertically. Time-dependent\nradiative heating (FUV) offsets gas cooling. We use our simulations to test a\nnew theory for self-regulated star formation. Consistent with this theory, the\ndisks evolve to a state of vertical dynamical equilibrium and thermal\nequilibrium with both warm and cold phases. The range of star formation surface\ndensities and midplane thermal pressures is Sigma_SFR ~ 0.0001 - 0.01\nMsun/kpc^2/yr and P_th/k_B ~ 100 -10000 cm^-3 K. In agreement with\nobservations, turbulent velocity dispersions are ~7 km/s and the ratio of the\ntotal (effective) to thermal pressure is P_tot/P_th~4-5, across this whole\nrange. We show that Sigma_SFR is not well correlated with Sigma alone, but\nrather with Sigma*(rho_sd)^1/2, because the vertical gravity from stars and\ndark matter dominates in outer disks. We also find that Sigma_SFR has a strong,\nnearly linear correlation with P_tot, which itself is within ~13% of the\ndynamical-equilibrium estimate P_tot,DE. The quantitative relationships we find\nbetween Sigma_SFR and the turbulent and thermal pressures show that star\nformation is highly efficient for energy and momentum production, in contrast\nto the low efficiency of mass consumption. Star formation rates adjust until\nthe ISM's energy and momentum losses are replenished by feedback within a\ndynamical time.\n", "authors": "Chang-Goo Kim, Woong-Tae Kim, Eve C.

Information on the average UV photodesorption yield of astrophysically\nimportant ices exists for broadband UV lamp experiments. UV fields around\nlow-mass pre-main sequence stars, around shocks and in many other astrophysical\nenvironments are however often dominated by discrete atomic and molecular\nemission lines. It is therefore crucial to consider the wavelength dependence\nof photodesorption yields and mechanisms. In this work, for the first time, the\nwavelength-dependent photodesorption of pure CO ice is explored between 90 and\n170 nm. The experiments are performed under ultra high vacuum conditions using\ntunable synchrotron radiation. Ice photodesorption is simultaneously probed by\ninfrared absorption spectroscopy in reflection mode of the ice and by\nquadrupole mass spectrometry of the gas phase. The experimental results for CO\nreveal a strong wavelength dependence directly linked to the vibronic\ntransition strengths of CO ice, implying that photodesorption is induced by\nelectronic transition (DIET). The observed dependence on the ice absorption\nspectra implies relatively low photodesorption yields at 121.6 nm (Ly-alpha),\nwhere CO barely absorbs, compared to the high yields found at wavelengths\ncoinciding with transitions into the first electronic state of CO (singulet Pi\nat 150 nm); the CO photodesorption rates depend strongly on the UV profiles\nencountered in different star formation environments.\n", "authors": "Edith C.

This virial state is a consequence of the low gas fractions within\nthe subclusters, caused by the accretion of gas onto the stars and the\naccretion-induced shrinkage of the subclusters. Because the subclusters are\ngas-poor, up to a length scale of 0.1-0.2 pc at the end of the simulation, they\nare only weakly affected by gas expulsion. The fraction of subclusters that\nreaches the high density required to evolve to a gas-poor state increases with\nthe density of the star-forming region. We extend this argument to star cluster\nscales, and suggest that the absence of gas indicates that the early disruption\nof star clusters due to gas expulsion (infant mortality) plays a smaller role\nthan anticipated, and is potentially restricted to star-forming regions with\nlow ambient gas densities.

The chemical processes during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nevolution of intermediate mass single stars predict most of the observations of\nthe different populations in globular clusters although some important issues\nstill need to be further clarified.

A recently developed tool (Marks, Kroupa & Oh) is used\nto evolve the binary star distributions in star clusters for a few Myr so that\na particular mixture of single and binary stars is achieved. On cluster\ndissolution the population enters the galactic field with these\ncharacteristics. The different contributions of single stars and binaries from\nindividual star clusters which are selected from a power-law embedded star\ncluster mass function are then added up. This gives rise to integrated galactic\nfield binary distribution functions (IGBDFs) resembling a galactic field's\nstellar content (Dynamical Population Synthesis). It is found that the binary\nproportion in the galactic field of a galaxy is larger the lower the minimum\ncluster mass, the lower the star formation rate, the steeper the embedded star\ncluster mass function and the larger the typical size of forming star clusters\nin the considered galaxy. In particular, period-, mass-ratio- and eccentricity\nIGBDFs for the Milky Way are modelled. The afore mentioned theoretical IGBDFs\nagree with independently observed distributions.

Knowing the column density in any direction\nat any location in space is a prerequisite for modelling the propagation of\nradiation through the computational domain. TreeCol therefore forms the basis\nfor a fast, approximate method for modelling the attenuation of radiation\nwithin large numerical simulations. It constructs a HEALPix sphere at any\ndesired location and accumulates the column density by walking the tree and by\nadding up the contributions from all tree nodes whose line of sight contributes\nto the pixel under consideration. In particular when combined with widely-used\ntree-based gravity solvers the new scheme requires little additional\ncomputational cost. In a simulation with $N$ resolution elements, the\ncomputational cost of TreeCol scales as $N \\log N$, instead of the $N^{5/3}$\nscaling of most other radiative transfer schemes. TreeCol is naturally\nadaptable to arbitrary density distributions and is easy to implement and to\nparallelize. We discuss its accuracy and performance characteristics for the\nexamples of a spherical protostellar core and for the turbulent interstellar\nmedium. We find that the column density estimates provided by TreeCol are on\naverage accurate to better than 10 percent.

The Na-poor, O-rich population can\nbe identified with the red MS, and the Na-rich, O-poor one with the blue one.\nThis may be understood in terms of different He content, He being correlated\nwith Na.

The aim\nof this study is to analyze the origin and evolution of the large HI shell\nGS100-02-41 and its role in triggering star forming processes.To characterize\nthe shell and its environs, we carry out a multi-wavelength study. We analyze\nhe HI 21 cm line, the radio continuum, and infrared emission distributions. The\nanalysis of the HI data shows an expanding shell structure centred at (l, b) =\n(100.6 deg, -2.04 deg) in the velocity range from -29 to -51.7 km/s.\n  We infer for GS100-02-41, a kinematical distance of 2.8 +/- 0.6 kpc. Several\nmassive stars belonging to Cep OB1 are located in projection within the large\nHI, shell boundaries. The analysis of the radio continuum and infrared data\nreveal that there is no continuum counterpart of the HI shell. On the other\nhand, three slightly extended radio continuum sources are observed in\nprojection onto the dense HI shell. From their flux density determinations we\ninfer that they are thermal in nature. An analysis of the HI emission\ndistribution in the environs of these sources shows, for each of them, a region\nof low emissivity having a good morphological correlation with the ionized gas\nin a velocity range similar to the one where GS100-02-41 is detected. The\norigin of GS100-02-41 could have been mainly due to the action of the Cep OB1\nmassive stars located inside the HI shell. The obtained age difference between\nthe HI shell and the HII regions, together with their relative location, led us\nto conclude that the ionizing stars could have been created as a consequence of\nthe shell evolution.\n", "authors": "L.

In this paper, we show an\nexample of a short tidal stream that is particularly sensitive to the shape of\nthe Milky Way's dark matter halo: the globular cluster tidal stream NGC 5466.\nThis stream has an interesting deviation from a smooth orbit at its western\nedge. We show that such a deviation favours an underlying oblate or triaxial\nhalo (irrespective of plausible variations in the Milky Way disc properties and\nthe specific halo parametrisation chosen); spherical or prolate halo shapes can\nbe excluded at a high confidence level.

At a\ndistance (~20 pc) that places it well inside the Local Bubble, the LLCC is the\nnearest example of the coldest known (T~20 K) diffuse interstellar clouds. The\nSTIS measurements of the C I fine-structure excitation toward HD 85259 and HD\n83023 indicate that the thermal gas pressure of the LLCC is much greater than\nthat of the warm clouds in the Local Bubble. The mean LLCC pressure measured\ntoward these two stars (60,000 cm$^{-3}$ K) implies an H I density of ~3000\ncm$^{-3}$ and a cloud thickness of ~200 AU at the 20 K cloud temperature. Such\na thin, cold, dense structure could arise at the collision interface between\nconverging flows of warm gas. However, the measured LLCC pressure is\nappreciably higher than that expected in the colliding cloud interpretation\ngiven the velocity and column density constraints on warm clouds in the HD\n85259 and HD 83023 sightlines. Additional STIS measurements of the Zn II, Ni\nII, and Cr II column densities toward HD 85259 indicate that the LLCC has a\nmodest \"warm cloud\" dust depletion pattern consistent with its low dust-to-gas\nratio determined from H I 21 cm and 100 micron observations. In support of the\ninferred sheet-like geometry for the LLCC, a multi-epoch comparison of the Na I\nabsorption toward a high-proper-motion background star reveals a 40% column\ndensity variation indicative of LLCC Na I structure on a scale of ~50 AU.\n", "authors": "David M.

Such\nan approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic\nsurveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes the orbit\ndistribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)\nproposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these\nparametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space\ndistributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars\n(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which\nenables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic\nmono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to\nconstrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint\nlikelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over\nthe DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection\nfunction inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the\nuncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,\nwe study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be\nreached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By\ncreating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and\nrealistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitational\npotential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with\nsample sizes of a few thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that\nare smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitations\nin our current study.\n", "authors": "Yuan-Sen Ting, Hans-Walter Rix, Jo Bovy, Glenn van de Ven"}]}
