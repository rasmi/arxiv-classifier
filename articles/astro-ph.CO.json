We\ndetermine the luminosity and temperature structure of the X-ray emitting gas,\nwith the goal to quantify the scatter and the evolution of the L_X - T\nrelation, as well as to investigate the dependence on cluster substructure with\nredshift. We confirm that L_X \\propto T^3 and we find a weak redshift\ndependence (\\propto (1+z)^(\\beta_LT), \\beta_LT=0.50 +- 0.34), in contrast to\nsome Chandra results. The level of dynamical activity is established using the\n\"power ratios\" method, and we find signs of evolution in the P_3/P_0 power\nratio. A new method, the \"temperature two-point correlation function,\" is\nproposed. This method is used to determine the \"power spectrum\" of temperature\nfluctuations in the X-ray emitting gas as a function of spatial scale. We show\nhow this method can be fruitfully used to identify cooling core clusters as\nwell as those with disturbed structures, presumably due to on-going or recent\nmerger activity.\n", "authors": "K.

Here,\nwe postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from gasrich disks is\ncontrolled by two parameters that characterize galaxy mergers, the mass ratio\nof merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity of the larger merging\nhalo. We utilize merger histories generated from realizations of the\ncosmological density field to calculate the fraction of dark matter halos that\nhave avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived statistics with the\nspheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby galaxies. We find, for\nexample, that the survival rate of disk-dominated galaxies in LCDM is just high\nenough to explain the observed fractional representation of disk-dominated\ngalaxies in the universe if the only mergers which lead to central spheroid\nformation are those with mass ratios M2/M1 > 0.3 and virial velocities Vvir,1 >\n55 km/s. We discuss the physical origin of this criterion, and show that the\ndependence of the disk-dominated fraction on galaxy mass provides a further\ntest of the merger hypothesis.

In common with some recent\nstudies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in major\nmergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift to\nz~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \\pm 1.6}. Our key finding is that massive galaxies with\nM_* > 1E11 Msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massive\nsystems (M_* ~ 1E10 Msun). We find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,\nspheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectations\nbased on clustering at small scales. So-called \"dry\" mergers between early-type\ngalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with M_* > 3E10 Msun at z~0.5, but\nless than 30% at z~1. This result can be explained by the increasing abundance\nof red, early-type galaxies at these masses. We compare the volumetric merger\nrate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxy\nevolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation of\nspheroidal galaxies since z~1. In terms of mass assembly, major mergers\ncontribute little to galaxy growth below M_* ~ 3E10 Msun but are more\nsignificant among galaxies with M_* > 1E11 Msun, 30% of which have undergone\nmostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range.

By utilizing the extensive multiwavelength\ndatasets available in the GOODS fields, we identify 2443 B, 506 V, and 137\ni'-band dropout galaxies likely to be at z~4, 5, and 6. With the goal of\nunderstanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies at\nz>4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function of\ncosmic time. We find that at a fixed rest-UV luminosity, the average stellar\nmasses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z~6 and 4. In\norder to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of high\nredshift LBGs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young,\nnewly-luminous objects at each successive redshift. When considered along with\nthe short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results may\nsuggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting only\nseveral hundred million years. In contrast to the unchanging relationship\nbetween the average stellar mass and rest-UV luminosity, we find that the\nnumber density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4<z<6.\nGiven this rapid increase of UV luminous massive galaxies, we explore the\npossibility that a significant fraction of massive (M*>1e11 Msun) z~2-3 distant\nred galaxies (DRGs) were in part assembled in an LBG phase at earlier times.\nIntegrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming LBGs\nover 4<z<6 down to z~2, we find that z>3 LBGs could have contributed\nsignificantly to the quiescent DRG population, indicating that the intense\nstar-forming systems probed by current sub-millimeter observations are not the\nonly route toward the assembly of DRGs at z~2.\n", "authors": "Daniel P.

Although only < 40 percent of the gas in the central 100 pc of\nthe galaxy is photoionized, we find that photoheating by massive stars causes a\nstrong dynamical response, which results in a weak correlation between\nluminosity emitted in hydrogen recombination lines and the total mass in stars.\nHowever, owing to the low escape fraction of He II-ionizing photons, the\nluminosity emitted in He II 1640 is much more strongly correlated with the\ntotal stellar mass. The ratio of the luminosity in He II 1640 to that in\nLy_alpha or H_alpha is found to be a good indicator of the IMF in many cases.\nThe ratio of observable fluxes is F_1640/F_Halpha ~ 1 for clusters of 100 M_Sun\nPop III stars and F_1640/F_Halpha ~ 0.1 for clusters of 25 M_Sun Pop III stars.\nThe EW of the He II 1640 emission line is the most reliable IMF indicator, its\nvalue varying between ~ 20 and ~ 200 angstrom for a massive and very massive\nPop III IMF, respectively.

Follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 24\nLBGs at 1.5<z<2.7. Among the optical spectra, 12 have Ly-alpha emission with\nrest-frame equivalent widths of ~5-60AA. The success rate for identifying LBGs\nas NUV-dropouts at 1.5<z<2.7 is 86%. The rest-frame UV (1700AA) luminosity\nfunction (LF) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections for\nstellar contamination and z<1.5 interlopers. The LF is 1.7+/-0.1 times higher\nthan those of z~2 BXs and z~3 LBGs. Three explanations were considered, and it\nis argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effective\ncomoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with the\nspectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would not\nresolve the discrepancy. The third scenario is that different photometric\nselection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such that\nsome BX galaxies are LBGs and vice versa. This argument is supported by a\nhigher surface density of LBGs at all magnitudes while the redshift\ndistribution of the two populations is nearly identical. This study, when\ncombined with other star-formation rate (SFR) density UV measurements from LBG\nsurveys, indicates that there is a rise in the SFR density: a factor of 3-6\n(3-10) increase from z~5 (z~6) to z~2, followed by a decrease to z~0. This\nresult, along with past sub-mm studies that find a peak at z~2 in their\nredshift distribution, suggest that z~2 is the epoch of peak star-formation.\nAdditional spectroscopy is required to characterize the complete shape of the\nz~2 LBG UV LF via measurements of contamination and accurate distances.\n", "authors": "Chun Ly, Matthew A.

We can neither confirm nor\nrefute the claims for a tight correlation between these radio halo and X-ray\nluminosities, i.e. whether the halo luminosity function of X-ray clusters is\nbimodal (having high/on and low/off states), or whether the radio luminosity\ncan take on a wide range of values up to a maximum at each cluster X-ray\nluminosity. The resolution of this issue may provide a unique diagnostic for\nthe timescales over which relativistic particles can be accelerated following\ncluster mergers. We discuss several important selection effects on radio vs.\nX-ray luminosity correlations, including surface brightness thresholds and\nnon-X-ray-selected diffuse radio sources.

We show that the bispectrum has the maximum\nsignal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordial\nbispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of the\nfirst-order terms in position space. However, detailed calculations show that\ntheir shapes are sufficiently different: the cross-correlation coefficient\nreaches 0.5 at the maximum multipole of l_{max}~ 200, and then weakens to 0.3\nat l_{max}~ 2000. The differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acoustic\noscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not being\nscale-invariant. This implies that the contamination of the primordial\nbispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of the\nfirst-order terms) is small.

This model assumes that the true CMB signal consists of a Gaussian\nisotropic random field modulated by a dipole, and is characterized by an\noverall modulation amplitude, A, and a preferred direction, p. Previous\nanalyses of this model has been restricted to very low resolution due to\ncomputational cost. In this paper, we double the angular resolution, and\ncompute the full corresponding posterior distribution for the 5-year WMAP data.\nThe results from our analysis are the following: The best-fit modulation\namplitude for l <= 64 and the ILC data with the WMAP KQ85 sky cut is A=0.072\n+/- 0.022, non-zero at 3.3sigma, and the preferred direction points toward\nGalactic coordinates (l,b) = (224 degree, -22 degree) +/- 24 degree. The\ncorresponding results for l <~ 40 from earlier analyses was A = 0.11 +/- 0.04\nand (l,b) = (225 degree,-27 degree). The statistical significance of a non-zero\namplitude thus increases from 2.8sigma to 3.3sigma when increasing l_max from\n40 to 64, and all results are consistent to within 1sigma.

A powerful way to observe these IMBHs is via gravitational waves the black\nholes emit as they merge.

Gaia and a dedicated SIMLite only weakly constrain the presence of\na cosmological constant at the ~1 sigma levels. We also investigate future\nmission concepts, such as an interferometer similar in scope and design to\nNASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder. This could in principle measure the dark\nenergy parameters w_0 and w_a with high precision, yielding a Figure of Merit\nlarger than the stage IV experiments considered by the the Dark Energy Task\nForce. Unlike perhaps all other probes of dark energy there appear to be no\nobvious astrophysical sources of systematic error. There is however uncertainty\nregarding the statistical errors. As well as measurement error, there will be\nsmall additional contributions from image centroiding of variable sources,\nquasar peculiar motions and weak microlensing by stars along the line of sight.\n", "authors": "Fiona Ding, Rupert A.

SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity.

We present improved solutions and we estimate the model\nparameters using bounds on the variation of the electron mass at different\ncosmic times. On the other hand, from results of experiments that test the Weak\nEquivalence Principle, we find a limit for the model's parameter, that comes\nfrom the variation of the electron mass induced by spatial variations of the\nscalar field.

Here, we\nidentify a hitherto unrecognized problem with this technique, related to how\nthe night sky flux is typically measured and subtracted from astronomical\nimages. While most of the sky flux comes from regions between the observer and\nthe target object, a small fraction - the extragalactic background light (EBL)\n- comes from behind. We argue that since this part of the sky flux can be\nsubject to extinction by dust present in the galaxy/group/cluster studied,\nstandard reduction procedures may lead to a systematic oversubtraction of the\nEBL. Even very small amounts of extinction can lead to spurious features in\nradial surface surface brightness profiles and colour maps of extended objects.\nWe assess the likely impact of this effect on a number of topics in\nextragalactic astronomy where very deep surface photometry is currently\nattempted, including studies of stellar halos, starburst host galaxies, disc\ntruncations and diffuse intragroup/intracluster light.

EBL extinction effects also mimic truncations in discs with\nunusually high dust opacities, but are unlikely to be the cause of such\nfeatures in general.

In addition, we\nhave improved our modeling of the instrument beams and have reduced our\nabsolute calibration uncertainty from 5% to 3.5% in temperature. The robustness\nof our results is confirmed through extensive jackknife tests and by way of the\nagreement we find between our two fully independent analysis pipelines. For the\nstandard 6-parameter LCDM model, the addition of QUaD data marginally improves\nthe constraints on a number of cosmological parameters over those obtained from\nthe WMAP experiment alone. The impact of QUaD data is significantly greater for\na model extended to include either a running in the scalar spectral index, or a\npossible tensor component, or both. Adding both the QUaD data and the results\nfrom the ACBAR experiment, the uncertainty in the spectral index running is\nreduced by ~25% compared to WMAP alone, while the upper limit on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is reduced from r < 0.48 to r < 0.33 (95% c.l). This is\nthe strongest limit on tensors to date from the CMB alone. We also use our\npolarization measurements to place constraints on parity violating interactions\nto the surface of last scattering, constraining the energy scale of Lorentz\nviolating interactions to < 1.5 x 10^{-43} GeV (68% c.l.). Finally, we place a\nrobust upper limit on the strength of the lensing B-mode signal.

Focusing on\nprimordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, we check that these results agree\nwith numerical simulations. The high-mass cutoff of the halo mass function\ntakes the same form as the one obtained from the Press-Schechter formalism, but\nwith a linear threshold $\\delta_L$ that depends on the definition of the halo.\nWe show that a simple formula, which obeys this high-mass asymptotic and uses\nthe fit obtained for Gaussian initial conditions, matches numerical simulations\nwhile keeping the mass function normalized to unity. Next, by deriving the\nreal-space halo two-point correlation in the spirit of Kaiser (1984) and taking\na Fourier transform, we obtain good agreement with simulations for the\ncorrection to the halo bias due to primordial non-Gaussianity. Therefore,\nneither the halo mass function nor the bias require an ad-hoc parameter $q$\nprovided one uses the correct linear threshold $\\delta_L$ and pays attention to\nhalo displacements. The nonlinear real-space expression can be useful for\nchecking that the \"linearized\" bias is a valid approximation. Moreover, it\nclearly shows how the baryon acoustic oscillation at $\\sim 100 h^{-1}$Mpc is\namplified by the bias of massive halos and modified by primordial\nnon-Gaussianity.

We quantify the\nmass growth rates via these two processes, dM_mer/dt and dM_dif/dt, and their\ndependence on halo environment using the ~500,000 haloes in the Millennium\nsimulation. Adopting a local mass density parameter as a measure of halo\nenvironment, we find the two rates show strong but opposite environmental\ndependence, with mergers playing an increasingly important role for halo\ngrowths in overdense regions and diffuse accretion dominating growth in voids.\nThis behaviour is independent of the mass cuts used to define haloes vs\nnon-haloes. For galaxy-scale haloes, these two opposite correlations largely\ncancel out, but a weak environmental dependence remains that results in a\nslightly lower mean total growth rate, and hence an earlier mean formation\nredshift, for haloes in denser regions. The mean formation redshift of the\n~5000 cluster-mass haloes, on the other hand, appears to have no correlation\nwith halo environment. The origin of the positive correlation of dM_mer/dt with\nlocal density can be traced to the surrounding mass reservoir outside the\nhaloes, where more progenitor haloes are available in denser regions. The\nnegative correlation of dM_dif/dt with density, however, is not explained by\nthe available diffuse mass in the reservoir, which is in fact larger in denser\nregions.

We study the evolution of accreting protostars and\nthe limits of accretion in low metallicity environments. Accretion rates onto\nprotostars are estimated via the temperature evolution of prestellar cores with\ndifferent metallicities. The derived rates increase with decreasing\nmetallicity, from 10^-6 M_sun/yr at Z = Z_sun to 10^-3 M_sun/yr at Z = 0. With\nthe derived accretion rates, the protostellar evolution is numerically\ncalculated. We find that, at lower metallicity, the protostar has a larger\nradius and reaches the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) at higher stellar mass.\nUsing this protostellar evolution, we evaluate the upper stellar mass limit\nwhere the mass accretion is hindered by radiative feedback. We consider the\neffects of radiation pressure exerted on the accreting envelope, and expansion\nof the HII region. The mass accretion is finally terminated by radiation\npressure on dust grains in the envelope for Z > 10^-3 Z_sun and by the\nexpanding HII region for lower metallicty. The mass limit from these effects\nincreases with decreasing metallicity from 10 M_sun at Z = Z_sun to about 300\nM_sun at Z = 10^-6 Z_sun. The termination of accretion occurs after the central\nstar arrives at the ZAMS at all metallicities, which allows us to neglect\nprotostellar evolution effects in discussing the upper mass limit by stellar\nfeedback.

We demonstrate that these\nstrong lensing only constraints are due to the perturbed strong lensing\nconfiguration, where the main arc is located at ~5\" from the galaxy, whereas\nits counter-image is found at ~8\". To test independently our resulting strong\nlensing model, we pursue an independent weak lensing analysis of the group and\nfind a mass-to-light ratio in the range 66-146 (1sigma confidence level).\n", "authors": "Marceau Limousin, Eric Jullo, Johan Richard, Remi Cabanac, Sherry H.

An optical\nspectroscopic follow-up of a sub-sample of 24 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs)\ndetected by GALEX at z ~ 0.2-0.3, combined with a UV-optical sample of local\nstarbursts, both with matched apertures, allow us to quantify the dust\nextinction through Balmer lines, and to estimate the Lyman-alpha escape\nfraction from the Halpha flux corrected for extinction in the framework of the\nrecombination theory. The global escape fraction of Lyman-alpha radiation spans\nnearly the entire range of values, from 0.5 to 100 %, and fesc(Lya) clearly\ndecreases with increasing nebular dust extinction E(B-V). Several objects show\nfesc(Lya) greater than fesc(continuum) which may be an observational evidence\nfor clumpy ISM geometry or for an aspherical ISM. Selection biases and aperture\nsize effects may still prevail between z ~ 0.2-0.3 LAEs and local starbursts,\nwhich may explain the difference observed for fesc(Lya).\n", "authors": "Hakim Atek, Daniel Kunth, Daniel Schaerer, Matthew Hayes, Jean-Michel Deharveng, Goran Ostlin, J.

A model assuming point source contamination in SZE clusters\nrenders a better fit to the one-dimensional SZE profiles thus suggesting that\ncontamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of the\nSZE signal. Selecting a model that better fits both X-ray and WMAP data away\nfrom the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and find\nthat on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mJy (at\n41 GHz), 26 mJy (at 61 GHz) and 18 mJy (at 94 GHz). These estimated fluxes are\nmarginally consistent with the estimated contamination derived from radio and\ninfrared surveys thus suggesting that the combination of a steeper gas profile\nand the contribution from point sources allows us to consistently explain the\nX-ray emission and SZE in galaxy clusters as measured by ROSAT and WMAP.\n", "authors": "J.

The available multi-band photometry covers the\nspectral range from the u-band up to 160 um. The observed SED of each object is\nfit to a set of multi-component models comprising a stellar component, a high\noptical depth torus and cold emission from a starburst (SB).

The comparison of type 1 (as derived\nfrom Hatziminaoglou et al. 2008) and type 2 AGN properties is broadly\nconsistent with the Unified Scheme. The estimated ratio between type 2 and type\n1 objects is about 2-2.5:1. The AGN accretion-to-infrared luminosity ratio is\nan indicator of the obscuration of the AGN since it scales down with the\ncovering factor. We find evidence supporting the receding torus paradigm, with\nthe estimated fraction of obscured AGN decreasing with increasing optical\nluminosity over four orders of magnitude.

We conclude that\nwe may be witnessing the building of the M(BH)-M(stellar bulge) relation, or at\nleast of a major event in that process. The star formation rate (~340 Msun/yr),\nage (40-200 Myr) and stellar mass ([5-6]x10^10 Msun) are consistent with\njet-induced formation of the companion galaxy.

In line with previous\nobservations, we find that 3C433 has an unresolved core source that is detected\nin all near-IR bands, but dominates over the host galaxy emission at 2.05 um.\nOur analysis reveals: (1) the presence of a dust lane aligned close to\nperpendicular (PA$=70\\pm5\\degr$) to the inner radio jet axis\n(PA$=-12\\pm2\\degr$); (2) a steep slope to the near-IR SED ($\\alpha=5.8\\pm0.1$;\nF$_{\\nu}\\propto\\nu^{-\\alpha}$); (3) an apparent lack of broad permitted\nemission lines at near-IR wavelengths, in particular the absence of a broad\nPa$\\alpha$ emission line; and (4) high intrinsic polarization for the\nunresolved core nuclear source ($8.6\\pm1$ per cent), with an E-vector\nperpendicular (PA=$83.0\\pm 2.3\\degr$) to the inner radio jet. Using five\nindependent techniques we determine an extinction to the compact core source in\nthe range 3<A_V<67 mag. An analysis of the long wavelength SED rules out a\nsynchrotron origin for the high near-IR polarization of the compact core\nsource. Therefore, scattering and dichroic extinction are plausible polarizing\nmechanisms, although in both of these cases the broad permitted lines from the\nAGN are required to have a width >10^4 km/s (FWHM) to escape detection in our\nnear-IR spectrum. Dichroic extinction is the most likely polarization mechanism\nbecause it is consistent with the various available extinction estimates. In\nthis case, a highly ordered, coherent toroidal magnetic field must be present\nin the obscuring structure close to the nucleus.\n", "authors": "Edgar A. Ramirez, C. N. Tadhunter, D. Axon, D.

We utilize the\nnon-parametric dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR) and the blue galaxy fraction (fb) to\ninvestigate the clustercentric radial-dependent changes in the cluster galaxy\npopulation. Composite cluster samples are combined by scaling the counting\nradius by r200 to minimize radius selection bias. The separation of galaxies\ninto a red and blue population was achieved by selecting galaxies relative to\nthe cluster color-magnitude relation. The DGR of the red and blue galaxies is\nfound to be independent of cluster richness (Bgc), although the DGR is larger\nfor the blue population at all measured radii. A decrease in the DGR for the\nred and red+blue galaxies is detected in the cluster core region, while the\nblue galaxy DGR is nearly independent of radius. The fb is found not to\ncorrelate with Bgc; however, a steady decline toward the inner-cluster region\nis observed for the giant galaxies. The dwarf galaxy fb is approximately\nconstant with clustercentric radius except for the inner cluster core region\nwhere fb decreases. The clustercentric radial dependence of the DGR and the\ngalaxy blue fraction, indicates that it is unlikely that a simple scenario\nbased on either pure disruption or pure fading/reddening can describe the\nevolution of infalling dwarf galaxies; both outcomes are produced by the\ncluster environment.\n", "authors": "Wayne A.

HI cooling on\naverage contributes 16-18% of the Lyman Alpha radiation produced by stars, but\nthis value can be much higher in low mass LAEs and further increased if the HI\nis clumpy. The continuum luminosity is instead almost completely dominated by\nstellar sources. The dust content of galaxies scales with their stellar mass,\nM_{dust} is proportional to M_*^0.7 and stellar metallicity, Z_*, such that\nM_{dust} is proportional to Z_*^1.7.

The only exceptions are galaxies with\ncircumnuclear rings of star formation where the most luminous Halpha emitting\nregions are found in the rings rather than in the nuclei, and the displacements\nare well understood in terms of differences in the stellar populations. A large\nfraction of the nuclei of these LIRGs are classified as LINER and intermediate\nLINER/HII, or composite objects. The excitation conditions of the integrated\nemission depend on the relative contributions of HII regions and the diffuse\nemission to the line emission over the PMAS FoV. Galaxies dominated by high\nsurface-brightness HII regions show integrated HII-like excitation. A few\ngalaxies show slightly larger integrated [NII]/Halpha and [SII]/Halpha line\nratios than the nuclear ones, probably because of more contribution from the\ndiffuse emission.

Of the spectra with adequate signal-to-noise, 148 spectra exhibit a\ndouble-peaked [OIII] profile. Of these, 86 are Type 1 AGN and 62 are Type 2\nAGN. Only two give the appearance of possibly being optically resolved double\nAGN in the SDSS images, but many show close companions or signs of recent\ninteraction. Radio-detected quasars are three times more likely to exhibit a\ndouble-peaked [OIII] profile than quasars with no detected radio flux,\nsuggesting a role for jet interactions in producing the double-peaked profiles.\nOf the 66 broad line (Type 1) AGN that are undetected in the FIRST survey, 0.9%\nshow double peaked [OIII] profiles. We discuss statistical tests of the nature\nof the double-peaked objects. Further study is needed to determine which of\nthem are binary AGN rather than disturbed narrow line regions, and how many\nadditional binaries may remain undetected because of insufficient line-of-sight\nvelocity splitting. Previous studies indicate that 0.1% of SDSS quasars are\nspatially resolved binaries, with typical spacings of ~10 to 100 kpc. If a\nsubstantial fraction of the double-peaked objects are indeed binaries, then our\nresults imply that binaries occur more frequently at smaller separations (< 10\nkpc). This suggests that simultaneous fueling of both black holes is more\ncommon as the binary orbit decays through these spacings.\n", "authors": "Krista L. Smith, G. A. Shields, E. W. Bonning, C. C.

It is shown that the\npositron to electron ratio, observed by PAMELA, may be fit over the entire\nenergy range in the nested leaky-box model for cosmic ray propagation and that\nthe ratio is expected to reach an asymptotic value of $\\sim0.6$ at high\nenergies in all conventional models of cosmic ray propagation. We also derive\nthe spectral shape of the electrons and positrons expected from the\nannihilation of dark matter in the Galaxy and show that the spectral shape of\nthe peak will provide important information, not only regarding the mass of the\ndark matter particles, but also regarding their spatial distribution. The\nspectrum of secondary positrons and electrons, calculated with the nested\nleaky-box model, is subtracted from the spectrum of the electronic component to\ndetermine the spectrum of primary electrons emerging from the cosmic ray\nsources. This spectrum is analyzed in terms of contributions from a set of\ndiscrete sources sprinkled across the Galactic volume. Our analysis suggests\nthe possible presence of electrons, accelerated in high Mach number shocks, in\nthe cosmic rays.\n", "authors": "R. Cowsik, B.

Here we consider an\nescape of nebular LyC from galaxies and examine the consequent spectral energy\ndistribution. It is usually assumed that hydrogen nebular LyC mostly produced\nby bound-free transitions is consumed within photo-ionized nebulae (so-called\n\"on-the-spot\" approximation). However, an escape of the continuum should be\ntaken into account if stellar LyC escapes from galaxies through\n\"matter-bounded\" nebulae. We show that the escaping hydrogen bound-free LyC\nmakes a strong bump just below the Lyman limit. Such a galaxy would be observed\nas a Lyman \"bump\" galaxy. This bump results from the radiation energy\nre-distribution of stellar LyC by nebulae. The strength of the bump depends on\nelectron temperature in nebulae, escape fraction of stellar and nebular LyC,\nhardness of stellar LyC (i.e. metallicity, initial mass function, age and star\nformation history), and IGM attenuation. We can use the bump to find very young\n($\\sim1$ Myr), massive ($\\sim100$ $M_\\odot$), and extremely metal-poor (or\nmetal-free) stellar populations at $z<4$. Because of the bump, 900 \\AA-to-1500\n\\AA luminosity density ratio (per Hz) becomes maximum (2--3 times larger than\nthe stellar intrinsic ratio) when about 40% of the stellar LyC is absorbed by\nnebulae. The total number of escaping LyC photons increases due to the escape\nof nebular LyC but does not exceed the stellar intrinsic one. The radiation\nenergy re-distribution by nebulae reduces the mean energy of escaping LyC only\nby $\\approx10$% relative to that of stellar LyC. Therefore, the effect of the\nescape of nebular LyC on the reionization process may be small.\n", "authors": "Akio K.

This\nbroad component is redshifted by ~80 km/s compared to the systemic velocity,\nwhile the narrow absorption is redshifted ~ 490 km/s. Both HI absorption\ncomponents are spatially resolved at the pc-scale of the VLBI observations. The\nbroad component shows strong gradients in density (or excitation) and velocity\nalong the jet. We conclude that this gas is physically close to the AGN,\nalthough the nature of the gas resulting in the broad absorption is not\ncompletely clear. The possibility that it is entrained by the radio jet appears\nunlikely. Gas located in a thick circum-nuclear toroidal structure cannot be\ncompletely ruled out although it appears difficult to reconcile with the\nobserved morphology and kinematics of the HI. A perhaps more likely scenario is\nthat the gas producing the broad absorption could be (directly or indirectly)\nconnected with the fuelling of the AGN, i.e. gas that is falling into the\nnucleus. If this is the case, the accretion rate derived is similar to that\nfound for other X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies, although lower than that\nderived from the radio core luminosity for NGC 315.

The Universe is now thought to be mostly composed by an invisible,\npressureless matter -potentially relic from higher energy theories- called\n\"dark matter\" (20-21%) and by an even more mysterious term, described in\nEinstein equations as a vacuum energy density, called \"dark energy\" (70%).

Weak gravitational lensing is believed\nto be the most promising tool to understand the nature of dark matter and to\nconstrain the cosmological model used to describe the Universe.

There\nis considerable overlap between this sample and a spectroscopically-confirmed\nsample drawn from the same survey and this allows us to determine the\nreliability of the optical photometric selection (~60 per cent) and to show\nthat the reliability can be significantly improved (to ~80 per cent) by\napplying near-infrared waveband criteria to exclude very red contaminants. Even\nthis high level of reliability may compromise some statistical studies of LBG\nproperties. We show that over 30 per cent of the highest reliability candidates\nhave multiple UV-luminous components and/or disturbed morphology in HST\nimaging, though it is unclear whether this represents multiple\ninteracting/merging sources or individual large sources with multiple UV bright\nregions. Using this sample we confirm that the normalisation of the bright end\nof the z=5 UV luminosity function (down to M*) is lower than the same at z=4 by\na factor of 3. Using a Schechter fit we determine M*uv=-20.9+/-0.2. We discuss\nwhether it is reasonable to expect the UV luminosity function to follow a\nSchechter function, given the UV emission is short-lived and stochastic, and\ndoes not necessarily trace the underlying mass of the galaxy.\n", "authors": "L.

First, LBGs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lie\non a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.\nThis is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[M*/Msun] = 9-11) in\nwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their star\nformation rate (SFR) increases.

Our constraints on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass\nrelations, measured within r_500, lead to three important results. First, the\ndata support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium has\naltered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally\ndominated system; however, this excess heating is primarily limited to the\ncentral regions of clusters (r<0.15r_500). Second, the intrinsic scatter in the\ncenter-excised luminosity-mass relation is remarkably small, being undetected\nat the <10% level in current data; for the hot, massive clusters under\ninvestigation, this scatter is smaller than in either the temperature-mass or\nY_X-mass relations (10-15%). Third, the evolution with redshift of the scaling\nrelations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of\ngravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating\nthe central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit\nof our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved\nstrongly since then.\n", "authors": "Adam Mantz, Steven W.

We find stellar masses that range over 0.1 -12x10^9 M_sol and\naverage ages from 20 Myr to up to 425 Myr with a mean of ~300 Myr, suggesting\nthat in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z>8 (and\nprobably at z>~10). The best fits to the observed SEDs are consistent with\nlittle or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z~4-8. The\nstar formation rates (SFR) are in the range from 5-20 M_sol/yr. From this\nsample we measure a stellar mass density of 6.6_{-3.3}^{+5.4}x10^5 M_sol/Mpc^3\nto a limit of M_{UV,AB}<-20 (or 0.4 L*(z=3)). Combined with a fiducial lower\nlimit for their ages (80 Myr) this implies a maximum SFR density of 0.008\nM_sol/yr/Mpc^3. This is well below the critical level needed to reionize the\nuniverse at z~8 using standard assumptions.

The self-calibration we apply removes a strong instrumental\nsignal from the fluctuations which would otherwise corrupt our results. The\nprocedures and results for masking bright sources, and modeling faint sources\ndown to levels set by the instrumental noise are presented. Various tests are\nperformed to demonstrate that the resulting power spectra of these fields are\nnot dominated by instrumental or procedural effects. These tests indicate that\nthe large scale (>~30') fluctuations that remain in the deepest fields are not\ndirectly related to the galaxies that are bright enough to be individually\ndetected. We provide the parameterization of these power spectra in terms of\nseparate instrument noise, shot noise, and power law components. Our\nmeasurements of spatial fluctuations of the CIB intensity indicate the mean\nemission from the objects producing the fluctuations is quite low (>~1 nW m-2\nsr-1 at 3-5 micron), and thus consistent with current gamma-ray absorption\nconstraints. The source of the fluctuations may be high-z Population III\nobjects, or a more local component of very low luminosity objects with\nclustering properties that differ from the resolved galaxies. Finally, we\ndiscuss the prospects of the upcoming space-based surveys to directly measure\nthe epochs inhabited by the populations producing these source-subtracted CIB\nfluctuations, and to isolate the individual fluxes of these populations.\n", "authors": "R.

There is\na pressing need to acquire better statistics about UV flaring and variability\nin galaxy nuclei, both in terms of the number and monitoring of targets. The\nScience Data Archive of the Hubble Space Telescope was queried to find all the\nelliptical galaxies with UV images obtained in different epochs with the Wide\nField Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) and possibly with nuclear spectra obtained\nwith the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) in the region of the\nHalpha emission line. These data were found only for the elliptical radiogalaxy\nNGC 4278. The UV flux of the nuclear source of NGC 4278 was measured by means\nof aperture photometry on the WFPC2/F218W images obtained between June 1994 and\nJanuary 1995. The mass of the central supermassive black hole (SBH) was\nestimated by measuring the broad components of the emission lines observed in\nthe STIS/G750M spectrum and assuming that the gas is uniformly distributed in a\nsphere. The nucleus of NGC 4278 hosts a barely resolved but strongly variable\nUV source. Its UV luminosity increased by a factor of 1.6 in a period of 6\nmonths. The amplitude and scale time of the UV flare in NGC 4278 are remarkably\nsimilar to those of the brightest UV nuclear transients which were earlier\nfound in other LLAGNs. The mass of the SBH was found to be in the range between\n7x10^7 and 2x10^9 M_sun.

MOND, indeed, predicts a quasi-universal value of this quantity\nfor objects of all masses and of any internal structure, provided they are\nmostly in the Newtonian regime; i.e., that their mean acceleration is at or\nabove a0. The predicted value is qSm, with Sm= a0/2 pi G= 138 solar masses per\nsquare parsec for the nominal value of a0, and q a constant of order 1 that\ndepends only on the form of the MOND interpolating function. This gives in the\nabove units log(Sm)=2.14, which is consistent with that found by Doanato et al.\nof 2.15+-0.2. MOND predicts, on the other hand, that this quasi-universal value\nis not shared by objects with much lower mean accelerations. It permits halo\ncentral surface densities that are arbitrarily small, if the mean acceleration\ninside the object is small enough. However, for such low-surface-density\nobjects, MOND predicts a halo surface density that scales as the square root of\nthe baryonic one, and so the range of the former is much compressed relative to\nthe latter. This explains, in part, the finding of Donato et al. that the\nuniversal value applies to low acceleration systems as well. Looking at\nliterature results for a number of the lowest surface-density disk galaxies\nwith rotation-curve analysis, I find that, indeed, their halo surface densities\nare systematically lower then the above \"universal\" value. The prediction of Sm\nas an upper limit, and accumulation value, of halo central surface densities,\npertains, unlike most other MOND predictions, to a pure \"halo\" property, not to\na relation between baryonic and \"dark matter\" properties.\n", "authors": "Mordehai Milgrom"}, {"category": "astro-ph.CO", "pubdate": "2009-09-29T05:02:10Z", "title": "Star Formation Histories within the Antennae Galaxies (Arp 244)", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5186v1", "summary": "  With the imagery from GALEX, HST, 2MASS, and Spitzer, and at the resolution\nof MIPS 24 micron(~6\"), we study the variations of the broadband spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming regions within the nearest\nprototypal major merger -- the Antennae galaxies.

We modelled\nthe 3-10 spectrum of each observation in a uniform way using a simple power-law\nmodel (with the addition of Gaussian line and/or edge to model the iron Kalpha\nemission/absorption features, if necessary) to consistently parametrize the\nshape of the observed X-ray continuum. We found that the average spectral slope\ndoes not correlate with source luminosity or black hole mass, while it\ncorrelates positively with the average accretion rate. We have also determined\nthe (positive) \"spectral slope-flux\" relation for each object, over a larger\nflux range than before. We found that this correlation is similar in almost all\nobjects. We discuss this global \"spectral slope-flux\" trend in the light of\ncurrent models for spectral variability. We consider (i) intrinsic variability,\nexpected e.g. from Comptonization processes, (ii) variability caused by\nabsorption of X-rays by a single absorber whose ionization parameter varies\nproportionally to the continuum flux variations, (iii) variability resulting\nfrom the superposition of a constant reflection component and an intrinsic\npower-law which is variable in flux but constant in shape, and, (iv)\nvariability resulting from the superposition of a constant reflection component\nand an intrinsic power-law which is variable both in flux and shape.

The method is an extension of that proposed by Tormen et\nal. (2004) and Giocoli et al.

On average, haloes\nwhich formed more recently tend to have a larger mass fraction in substructure\nand to be less concentrated than average haloes of the same mass. We provide\nquantitative fits to these correlations. Even though our algorithm is very\ndifferent from that of Gao et al.

This universality\nextends to any redshift only if one accounts for the fact that host haloes of a\ngiven mass are less concentrated at higher redshifts, and concentration and\nsubstructure abundance are anti-correlated. This universality allows a simple\nparametrization of the subhalo mass function integrated over all host halo\nmasses, at any given time. We provide analytic fits to this function which\nshould be useful in halo model analyses which equate galaxies with halo\nsubstructure when interpreting clustering in large sky surveys.

A promising\nstrategy is to target emission-line (i.e. star-forming) galaxies at\nhigh-redshift (z~0.5-2); not only is the space density of this population\nincreasing out to z~2, but also emission-lines provide an efficient method of\nredshift determination.

To answer this question, we use self-consistent simulations of the\nco-evolution of the BH and galaxy populations that reproduce the observed\ncorrelations between the masses of the BHs and the properties of their host\ngalaxies. We first confirm unambiguously that the BHs regulate their growth:\nthe amount of energy that the BHs inject into their surroundings remains\nunchanged when the fraction of the accreted rest mass energy that is injected,\nis varied by four orders of magnitude.

The accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc\nwhen the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\\dot{M}_Edd, and a geometrically thick,\nradiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below this\nvalue. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observations\nvery well, and the mass of the SMBH correlates with the mass of the galaxy\nbulge as observed. The BH spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gas\nin any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion)\nor whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly aligned\naccretion episodes (chaotic accretion). In the chaotic accretion model there is\na clear correlation of spin with SMBH mass. Massive BHs (M>5\\times10^8\\Msun)\nare hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lower\nmass BHs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. Using the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, our\nmodel is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio galaxies, LINERS and\nSeyferts. This is the first confirmation that a CDM galaxy formation model can\nreproduce the observed phenomenology of AGN.\n", "authors": "N. Fanidakis, C. M. Baugh, A. J. Benson, R. G. Bower, S. Cole, C.

Here, after subtracting all member galaxies, we use\nthe velocity distribution of the remaining stars and detect two dynamically,\nwell-distinct stellar components within simulated galaxy clusters. These\ndifferences in the dynamics can be used to apply an un-binding procedure which\nleads to a spatial separation of the two components into a cD and a diffuse\nstellar component (DSC). Applying our new algorithm to a cosmological,\nhydrodynamical simulation we find that -- in line with previous studies --\nthese two components have clearly distinguished spatial and velocity\ndistributions as well as different star formation histories.

We directly compare the stellar populations of LBGs with and without\nstrong Lya emission, where we designate the former group (EW > 20 AA) as Lya\nemitters (LAEs) and the latter group (EW < 20 AA) as non-LAEs. This controlled\nmethod of comparing objects from the same UV luminosity distribution represents\nan improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of LBGs\nand narrowband-selected LAEs were contrasted, where the latter were often\nintrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply due\nto different selection criteria. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find\nthat Lya equivalent width and age, SFR, and dust extinction, respectively, are\nsignificantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong Lya emission\nalso tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty than\nobjects with weak Lya emission, or the line in absorption. We accordingly\nconclude that, within the LBG sample, objects with strong Lya emission\nrepresent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-induced\noutflows have reduced the dust covering fraction.

At large comoving wavenumber, the characteristic growth rate becomes\nindependent of spatial scale and constant: (t_{KH}a)^-1 ~ (128 pi G/9 kappa_T\nc)(rho_m/rho_b), where \"a\" is the scale factor, rho_m and rho_b are the matter\nand baryon energy density, respectively, and kappa_T is the Thomson opacity.\nThis is the characteristic timescale for a fluid parcel to radiate away its\nthermal energy content at the Eddington limit, analogous to the Kelvin-Helmholz\n(KH) time for a massive star or the Salpeter time for black hole growth.\nAlthough this mode grows at all times prior to decoupling and on scales smaller\nthan the horizon, the growth time is long, about 100 times the age of the\nuniverse at decoupling. Thus, it modifies the density and temperature\nperturbations on small scales only at the percent level. The physics of this\nmode is already accounted for in the popular codes CMBFAST and CAMB, but is\ntypically neglected in analytic studies of the growth of primordial\nperturbations. This work clarifies the physics of this instability in the epoch\nbefore decoupling, and emphasizes that the universe is formally unstable on\nscales below the horizon, even in the limit of large taudot. Analogous\ninstabilities at yet earlier epochs are also mentioned. (Abridged)\n", "authors": "Todd A.

We study their evolution by computing the [OIII]5007A line\nluminosity function (LF) and we constrain the fraction of obscured AGN as a\nfunction of luminosity and redshift. The sample was selected on the basis of\nthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N) of the relevant lines. We used the standard diagnostic diagrams\n[OIII]/Hbeta versus [NII]/Halpha and ([OIII]/Hbeta versus [SII]/Halpha) to\nisolate AGN in the redshift range 0.15<z<0.45 and the diagnostic diagram\n[OIII]/Hbeta versus [OII]/Hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift\n(0.5<z<0.92). Combining our sample with one drawn from SDSS, we found that the\nbest description of the evolution of type-2 AGN is a luminosity-dependent\ndensity evolution model. Moreover, using the type-1 AGN LF we were able to\nconstrain the fraction of type-2 AGN to the total (type-1 + type-2) AGN\npopulation. We found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, in\nagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increase\nwith redshift. However, the trend with luminosity is visible only after\ncombining the SDSS+zCOSMOS samples. From the COSMOS data points alone, the\ntype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.\n", "authors": "A. Bongiorno, M. Mignoli, G. Zamorani, F. Lamareille, G. Lanzuisi, T. Miyaji, M.

In this study we\ndevelop a method that can constrain the dark matter correlation function from\ngalaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements, by focusing on the\ncorrelation coefficient between the galaxy and matter overdensity fields. To\ngenerate a mock galaxy catalogue for testing purposes, we use the Halo\nOccupation Distribution approach applied to a large ensemble of N-body\nsimulations to model pre-existing SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy sample observations.\nUsing this mock catalogue, we show that a direct comparison between the excess\nsurface mass density measured by lensing and its corresponding galaxy\nclustering quantity is not optimal. We develop a new statistic that suppresses\nthe small-scale contributions to these observations and show that this new\nstatistic leads to a cross-correlation coefficient that is within a few percent\nof unity down to 5 Mpc/h. Furthermore, the residual incoherence between the\ngalaxy and matter fields can be explained using a theoretical model for\nscale-dependent bias, giving us a final estimator that is unbiased to within\n1%. We also perform a comprehensive study of other physical effects that can\naffect the analysis, such as redshift space distortions and differences in\nradial windows between galaxy clustering and weak lensing observations.

One of the\nmain difficulties for this unification is that between inflation and dark\nmatter one needs a successful reheating process and a long lasting period of\nradiation. Therefore the amount of energy density in the inflaton-dark matter\nfield phi must be fine tune after reheating to give dark matter. Here we show\nan alternative scheme in which the inflaton decays completely, disappearing\nentirely from the spectrum. However, at low energies, before matter-radiation\nequality, the same interaction term that leads to the inflaton decay,\nregenerates phi. An essential feature is that the transition between the\nintermediate radiation dominated to the dark matter phase is related to a\nquantum generation of the scalar field \\phi instead to purely classical\ndynamics. Thanks to this quantum transition the inflation-dark matter\nunification can take place naturally without fine tuning. The unification\nscheme presented here has three parameters, the mass of the dark matter\nparticle m_o, the inflation parameter lambda and the coupling g for the\ninflaton interaction.

One of the key\nproposals to offset radiative energy losses is thermal conduction from outer,\nhotter layers of cool core clusters to their centers. However, conduction is\nsensitive to magnetic field topology. In cool-core clusters the heat buoyancy\ninstability (HBI) leads to B-fields ordered preferentially in the direction\nperpendicular to that of gravity, which significantly reduces the level of\nconduction below the classical Spitzer-Braginskii value. However, the cluster\ncool cores are rarely in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Sloshing motions due\nto minor mergers, galaxy motions or AGN can significantly perturb the gas and\naffect the level of thermal conduction. We perform 3D AMR MHD simulations of\nthe effect of turbulence on the properties of the anisotropic thermal\nconduction in cool core clusters. We show that very weak subsonic motions, well\nwithin observational constraints, can randomize the magnetic field and\nsignificantly boost effective thermal conduction beyond the saturated values\nexpected in the pure unperturbed HBI case.

We use deep long slit\nspectra obtained with the FORS2 spectrograph at the VLT in the optical and\nnear-infrared wavelength ranges for the brightest HII regions in the disk polar\ndisk of NGC 4650A.

The deep spectra available allowed us to measure\nthe Oxygen abundances (12 + log (O/H)) using the \"Empirical method\" based on\nintensities of the strongest emission lines, and the \"Direct method\", based on\nthe determination of the electron temperature from the detection of weak\nauroral lines, as the [OIII] at 4363 Angstrom. The Oxygen abundance measured\nfor the polar disk is then compared with those measured for different galaxy\ntypes of similar total luminosities, and then compared against the predictions\nof different polar ring formation scenarios. The average metallicity values for\nthe polar disk in NGC 4650A is Z=0.2 Zsun, and it is lower that the values\nmeasured for ordinary spirals of similar luminosity.

I selected a sample of 11 clumpy\ngalaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line,\nintermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV\nmorphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used\nat higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the\nframe of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field\nspectrograph.

Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent\nwith Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show\nlarge-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the\ncontribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump\nformation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2,\nwhich could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical\nimages of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which\nthe stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former\ncorrespond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass\ndistribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation\nrelies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where\nclumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be\nsignificant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly\nsuppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy\ngalaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism.

Third, we place constraints on the column\ndensity of hot haloes using nondetections of OVII absorption along AGN\nsightlines: in general they must contain less than 70% of the missing baryons\nor extend to no more than 40 kpc. Flattening the density profile of galactic\nhot haloes weakens the surface brightness constraint so that a typical L$_*$\ngalaxy may hold half its missing baryons in its halo, but the OVII constraint\nremains unchanged, and around the Milky Way a flattened profile may only hold\n$6-13%$ of the missing baryons from the Galaxy ($2-4 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$). We also show that AGN and supernovae at low to moderate redshift -\nthe theoretical sources of winds responsible for driving out the missing\nbaryons - do not produce the expected correlations with the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relationship and so are insufficient to explain the missing\nbaryons from galaxies. We conclude that most of missing baryons from galaxies\ndo not lie in hot haloes around the galaxies, and that the missing baryons\nnever fell into the potential wells of protogalaxies in the first place. They\nmay have been expelled from the galaxies as part of the process of galaxy\nformation.\n", "authors": "Michael E. Anderson, Joel N.

The lag between the\noptical and sub-mm outbursts may indicate that these two peaks arise from two\ndistinct regions along the jet separated by a distance of 0.07-5 pc. The flux\nat 5-35 microns varied by a factor of 40 and the IR peak varied in frequency\nfrom <1E13 Hz to 4E13 Hz between the highest and lowest states in 2005 and\n2006, respectively. Variability was well correlated across the mid-IR band,\nwith no measurable lag. Flares that doubled in flux occurred on a time scale of\n3 days. The IR SED peak moved to higher frequency as a flare brightened, then\nreturned to lower frequency as it decayed. The fractional variability amplitude\nincreased with frequency, which we attribute to decreasing synchrotron-self\nabsorption optical depth. Mid-IR flares may signal the re-energization of a\nshock that runs into inhomogeneities along the pre-existing jet or in the\nexternal medium. The synchrotron peak frequencies during each major outburst\nmay depend upon both the distance from the jet apex and the physical conditions\nin the shocks.

The effect\nof magnetic fields is included in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation by\nsplitting the Lorentz force into two terms one being the force due to magnetic\npressure which acts outwards and the other being magnetic tension which acts\ninwards. A perturbative approach is adopted to solve for the gas density\nprofile for weak magnetic fields (< 4 micro G}). This leads to an enhancement\nof the gas density in the central regions for nearly radial magnetic field\nconfigurations. Previous works had considered the force due to magnetic\npressure alone which is the case only for a special set of field\nconfigurations.

Moreover, the abundance of\nstrong lensing events can be used to constrain the structure formation and the\ncosmological parameters through the so-called \"arc-statistics\" approach.\nHowever, several issues related to the usage of strong lensing clusters in\ncosmological applications are still controversial, leading to the suspect that\nseveral biases may affect this very peculiar class of objects. With this study\nwe aim at better understanding the properties of galaxy clusters which can\npotentially act as strong lenses. We do so by investigating the properties of a\nlarge sample of galaxy clusters extracted from the N-body/hydrodynamical\nsimulation MareNostrum Universe. We explore the correlation between the cross\nsection for lensing and many properties of clusters, like the mass, the\nthree-dimensional and projected shapes, their concentrations, the X-ray\nluminosity and the dynamical activity. We find that the probability of strong\nalignments between the major axes of the lenses and the line of sight is a\ngrowing function of the lensing cross section. In projection, the strong lenses\nappear rounder within R200, but we find that their cores tend to be more\nelliptical as the lensing cross section increases. We also find that the\ncluster concentrations estimated from the projected density profiles tend to be\nbiased high. The X-ray luminosity of strong lensing clusters is higher than\nthat of normal lenses of similar mass and redshift. This is particular\nsignificant for the least massive lenses. Finally, we find that the strongest\nlenses generally exhibit an excess of kinetic energy within the virial radius,\nindicating that they are more dynamically active than usual clusters.\n", "authors": "Massimo Meneghetti, Cosimo Fedeli, Francesco Pace, Stefan Gottloeber, Gustavo Yepes"}, {"category": "astro-ph.CO", "pubdate": "2010-03-24T12:19:29Z", "title": "Broad Balmer-line Absorption in SDSS J172341.10+555340.5", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4622v2", "summary": "  I present the discovery of Balmer-line absorption from H alpha to H9 in iron\nlow-ionizaton broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) quasar, SDSS~J172341.10+555340.5\nby near-infrared spectroscopy with the Cooled Infrared Spectrograph and Camera\nfor OHS (CISCO) attached to the Subaru telescope.

First, using\nsimplified smoothly-growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different\nalgorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a\nfactor of ~5 for massive haloes (>10^{12}Msun). The algorithms are in better\nagreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore,\ntheir cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate.

Second, we study the gas accretion history of the\ncentral galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of\nmergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies\nwithin small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion\nin the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high mass\nhaloes and 0.1 dex for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion\nrate is about two times larger.

The CO/13CO 1-0\nline intensity ratio can be used as a tracer of how dynamics and star formation\nprocesses impact the gas properties. The Medusa (NGC~4194) merger is\nparticularly interesting to study since its LFIR/LCO ratio rivals that of\nultraluminous galaxies (ULIRGs), despite the comparatively modest luminosity,\nindicating an exceptionally high star formation efficiency (SFE) in the Medusa\nmerger.\n  Interferometric OVRO observations of CO and 13CO 1-0 in the Medusa show the\nCO/13CO intensity ratio increases from normal, quiescent values (7-10) in the\nouter parts (r>2 kpc) of the galaxy to high (16 to >40) values in the central\n(r<1 kpc) starburst region. In the centre there is an east-west gradient where\nthe line ratio changes by more than a factor of three over 5\" (945 pc). The\nintegrated 13CO emission peaks in the north-western starburst region while the\ncentral CO emission is strongly associated with the prominent crossing\ndust-lane. We discuss the central east-west gradient in the context of gas\nproperties in the starburst and the central dust lane. We suggest that the\ncentral gradient is mainly caused by diffuse gas in the dust lane. In this\nscenario, the actual molecular mass distribution is better traced by the 13CO\n1-0 emission than the CO. The possibilities of temperature and abundance\ngradients are also discussed. We compare the central gas properties of the\nMedusa to those of other minor mergers and suggest that the extreme and\ntransient phase of the Medusa star formation activity has similar traits to\nthose of high-redshift galaxies.\n", "authors": "S.

The ionizing fluxes, UV continuum properties, and predicted\nLy alpha and HeII 1640 A line strengths are presented for synthesis models\ncovering a wider range of parameter space than our earlier calculations. Strong\ndepartures from case B predictions are obtained for Ly alpha and two-photon\ncontinuum at low metallicities. At low nebular densities both are shown to be\nenhanced proportionally to the mean energy carried by the Lyman continuum\nphotons emitted by the ionizing source. Larger Ly alpha equivalent widths are\ntherefore predicted at low metallicity. The HeII 1640 A line can be weaker than\ncase B predicts (in terms of flux as well as the equivalent width) due to its\nionization parameter dependence and to the enhanced underlying two-photon\ncontinuum.

Considering only galaxies with good\nphotometry and spectral measurements, we define four luminosity-threshold\nsamples within the redshift range 0.01<z<0.17, each containing more than 48000\ngalaxies. Colour gradients are calculated for these galaxies from the surface\nbrightness measurements provided by the SDSS DR7. Possible systematic effects\nin their determination have been analysed.

However, well-sampled\nspectral energy distributions of the nearby, star-forming Magellanic Clouds\nhave a pronounced (sub-)millimeter excess (Israel et al., 2010). This study\nattempts to confirm the existence of such a millimeter excess above expected\ndust, free-free and synchrotron emission and to explore different possibilities\nfor its origin. We model NIR to radio spectral energy distributions of the\nMagellanic Clouds with dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. A millimeter\nexcess emission is confirmed above these components and its spectral shape and\nintensity are analysed in light of different scenarios: very cold dust, Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) fluctuations, a change of the dust spectral index\nand spinning dust emission. We show that very cold dust or CMB fluctuations are\nvery unlikely explanations for the observed excess in these two galaxies. The\nexcess in the LMC can be satisfactorily explained either by a change of the\nspectral index due to intrinsic properties of amorphous grains, or by spinning\ndust emission. In the SMC however, due to the importance of the excess, the\ndust grain model including TLS/DCD effects cannot reproduce the observed\nemission in a simple way. A possible solution was achieved with spinning dust\nemission, but many assumptions on the physical state of the interstellar medium\nhad to be made. Further studies, using higher resolution data from Planck and\nHerschel, are needed to probe the origin of this observed submm-cm excess more\ndefinitely.

We isolate how, when, and exactly what gas is\nheated by AGN. Interestingly, we find that the gas that constitutes the\npresent-day IGrM is that which was not strongly heated by AGN. Instead, the low\nmedian density/high median entropy of the gas in present-day groups is achieved\nby the ejection of lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies at high\nredshift (primarily 2 < z < 4).

The H_alpha images frequently reveal\nextended structures that are not visible in the continuum, such as HII regions\nin spiral arms, tidal tails, rings, of up to few kpc from the nuclear regions.\nThe morphologies of the continuum and H_alpha images are studied on the basis\nof the C_{2kpc} parameter, which measures the concentration of the emission\nwithin the central 2 kpc. The C_{2kpc} values found for the H_alpha images are\nhigher than those of the continuum for the majority (85%) of the objects in our\nsample. On the other hand, most of the objects in our sample (~62%) have more\nthan half of their H_alpha emission outside the central 2 kpc. No clear trends\nare found between the values of C_{2kpc} and the IR-luminosity of the sources.\nOn the other hand, our results suggest that the star formation in advance\nmergers and early-stage interactions is more concentrated than in isolated\nobjects. We compared the H_alpha and infrared emissions as tracers of the\nstar-formation activity. We find that the star-formation rates derived using\nthe H_alpha luminosities generally underpredict those derived using the IR\nluminosities, even after accounting for reddening effects.\n", "authors": "Javier Rodriguez Zaurin, Santiago Arribas, Ana Monreal Ibero, Luis Colina, Almudena Alonso Herrero, Julia Alfonso Garzon"}, {"category": "astro-ph.CO", "pubdate": "2010-09-01T09:20:25Z", "title": "LABOCA observations of giant molecular clouds in the south west region\n  of the Small Magellanic Cloud", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0124v1", "summary": "  The amount of molecular gas is a key for understanding the future star\nformation in a galaxy.

Our main result is the discovery of three new\ndynamical mechanisms that can support structures in a barred-spiral grand\ndesign system. These mechanisms are presented in characteristic cases, where\nthese dynamical phenomena take place. They refer firstly to the support of a\nstrong bar, of ansae type, almost solely by chaotic orbits, then to the support\nof spirals by chaotic orbits that for a certain number of pat tern revolutions\nfollow an n:1 (n=7,8) morphology, and finally to the support of spiral arms by\na combination of orbits trapped around L$_{4,5}$ and sticky chaotic orbits with\nthe same Jacobi constant. We have encountered these dynamical phenomena in a\nlarge fraction of the cases we studied as we varied the parameters of our\ngeneral models, without forcing in some way their appearance.

Interestingly, we find that the fraction of S0s also correlates\nwith local galaxy density, in contrast to the findings of a study of the cores\nof 10 clusters at similar redshift by Dressler et al. We suggest that this\napparent inconsistency is due to differences in the spatial coverage around\nclusters, which is supported by the fact that the correlation disappears for\nS0s within a radius of 0.6R_200 of MACSJ0717. We interpret this result as\nevidence of the morphology-density relation being caused by a combination of\nmorphological transformation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions, and\neffects related to the formation and evolution of large-scale structure. In\nenvironments of low to intermediate density, where galaxy-galaxy interactions\nare frequent and efficient, the observed pronounced morphology-density relation\nfor S0s reflects the density dependence of the interaction cross section. In\nclusters, however, the correlation disappears for S0s, as the much higher\ngalaxy velocities in clusters not only lower the interaction cross section, but\nalso cause a spatial redistribution of galaxies that all but destroys such a\ncorrelation. This argument does not hold for elliptical galaxies in clusters\nwhich, having formed much earlier, have settled into the large-scale cluster\npotential; hence the morphology-density relation for cluster ellipticals may\nreflect primarily the state of advanced dynamical relaxation of this population\nwithin the cluster rather than a causal link to the environment responsible for\nthe morphological transformation of galaxies.\n", "authors": "C. -J.

At lower redshifts (z<2) some of the\nexplored models deviate from the data. This is due to too short merging\ntimescales and inefficient 'radio-mode' AGN feedback. Our results show that a\nstrong evolution in mass predicted by hierarchical models is compatible with no\nevolution on the bright-end of the K-band LF from z=3 to the local universe.\nThis means that, at high redshifts and contrary to what is commonly accepted,\nK-band emission is not necessarily a good tracer of galaxy mass.\n", "authors": "Bruno Henriques, Claudia Maraston, Pierluigi Monaco, Fabio Fontanot, Nicola Menci, Gabriella De Lucia, Chiara Tonini"}, {"category": "astro-ph.CO", "pubdate": "2010-09-07T20:09:50Z", "title": "Scale-Dependent Bias of Galaxies from Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1393v1", "summary": "  Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) modulate the density ratio of baryons\nto dark matter across large regions of the Universe.

The lack of \\lya emission in\nDLAs is consistent with the in situ star formation, for a given N(HI), being\nless efficient than what is seen in local galaxies.

The latter may well be true since we detect strong OVI absorption in\nthe stacked spectrum, indicating that DLAs are associated with a highly ionized\nphase possibly the relics of galactic winds and/or originating from cold\naccretion flows.

Our\nfull solution of the scalar field perturbation confirms that, when the\npotential is not too nonlinear, the effects of the scalar field could be\naccurately approximated as a modification of background expansion rate plus a\nrescaling of the effective gravitational constant relevant for structure\ngrowth. For the models we consider, these have opposite effects, leading to a\nweak net effect in the linear perturbation regime. However, on the nonlinear\nscales the modified expansion rate dominates and could produce interesting\nsignatures in the matter power spectrum and mass function, which might be used\nto improve the constraints on the models from cosmological data. We show that\nthe density profiles of the dark matter halos are well described by the\nNavarro-Frenk-White formula, although the scalar field could change the\nconcentration. We also derive an analytic formula for the scalar field\nperturbation inside halos assuming NFW density profile and sphericity, which\nagrees well with numerical results if the parameter is appropriately tuned. The\nresults suggest that for the models considered, the spatial variation of the\nscalar field (and thus the locally measured gravitational constant) is very\nweak, and so local experiments could see the background variation of\ngravitational constant.\n", "authors": "Baojiu Li, David F.
