In contrast to previous studies in the Orion\nNebula Cluster and NGC 2264, we do not see a clear signature of disk braking in\nTau-Aur and Cha I. We find that both accretors and non-accretors have similar\ndistributions of v sin i. The rotational velocities in both regions show a\nclear mass dependence, with F--K stars rotating on average about twice as fast\nas M stars, consistent with results reported for other clusters of similar age.\nSimilarly, we find the upper envelope of the observed values of specific\nangular momentum j varies as M^0.5 for our sample which spans a mass range of\n~0.16 to ~3 M_sun. This power law complements previous studies in Orion which\nestimated j is proportional to M^0.25 for < ~2 Myr stars in the same mass\nregime, and a sharp decline in j with decreasing mass for older stars (~10 Myr)\nwith M < 2 M_sun. For a subsample of 67 objects with mid-IR photometry, we\nexamine the connection between accretion signatures and dusty disks: in the\nvast majority of cases (63/67), the two properties correlate well, which\nsuggests that the timescale of gas accretion is similar to the lifetime of\ninner disks.\n", "authors": "Duy Cuong Nguyen, Ray Jayawardhana, Marten H. van Kerkwijk, Alexis Brandeker, Alexander Scholz, Ivana Damjanov"}, {"category": "astro-ph.SR", "pubdate": "2009-01-31T16:30:44Z", "title": "A Spitzer Study of 21 and 30 Micron Emission in Several Galactic\n  Carbon-rich Proto-Planetary Nebulae", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.0077v1", "summary": "  We have carried out mid-infrared spectroscopy of seven Galactic\nproto-planetary nebulae (PPNs) using the Spitzer Space Telescope.

These have the same shape and central wavelength (20.1\nmicrons) as found in the ISO spectra of the brighter PPNs. The 30 micron\nfeature was seen in all seven objects. However, it is not resolved into two\nseparate features (26 and 33 microns) as was claimed on the basis of ISO\nspectra, which presumably suffered from the noisy detector bands in this\nregion. All showed the infrared aromatic bands (AIB) at 11.3, 12.4, and 13.3\nmicrons. Five of these also appear to have the C2H2 molecular band at 13.7\nmicrons, one in absorption and four in emission. This is extremely rare, with\nonly one other evolved star, IRC+10216, in which C2H2 emission has been\nobserved. Four also possessed a broad, unidentified emission feature at 15.8\nmicrons that may possibly be related to the 21 micron feature. Model fits were\nmade to the spectral energy distributions for these PPNs to determine\nproperties of the detached circumstellar envelopes. The 21 micron feature has\nbeen seen in all Galactic carbon-rich PPNs observed, and thus its carrier\nappears to be a common component of the outflow around these objects.\n", "authors": "Bruce J.

The aim of this study is to understand\nthe evolution timescale of circumstellar debris discs, and the physical\nmechanisms responsible for such evolution around solar-type stars. In addition,\nwe perform a detailed characterisation of the detected debris discs.\nTheoretically, the mass of the disc is expected to decrease with time. In order\nto test this hypothesis, we performed the generalised Kendall's tau correlation\nand three different two-sample tests. A characterisation of the detected debris\ndiscs has been obtained by computing the collision and Poynting-Robertson\ntimescales and by modelling the spectral energy distribution. The Kendall's tau\ncorrelation yields a probability of 76% that the mass of debris discs and their\nage are correlated. Similarly, the three two-sample tests give a probability\nbetween 70 and 83% that younger and older debris systems belong to different\nparent populations in terms of dust mass. We detected submillimetre/millimetre\nemission from six debris discs, enabling a detailed SED modelling. Our results\non the correlation and evolution of dust mass as a function of age are\nconditioned by the sensitivity limit of our survey. Deeper millimetre\nobservations are needed to confirm the evolution of debris material around\nsolar-like stars. In the case of the detected discs, the comparison between\ncollision and Poynting-Robertson timescales supports the hypothesis that these\ndiscs are collision dominated.

The main application is for systems\ninvolving a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star and an OB star companion. The WR wind is\nassumed to dominate the forbidden line emission. The colliding wind interaction\nis treated as an archimedean spiral with an inner boundary. Under the\nassumptions of the model, the major findings are as follows. (a) The\nredistribution of the WR wind as a result of the wind collision is not flux\nconservative but typically produces an excess of line emission; however, this\nexcess is modest at around the 10% level. (b) Deviations from a flat-top\nprofile shape for a spherical wind are greatest for viewing inclinations that\nare more nearly face-on to the orbital plane. At intermediate viewing\ninclinations, profiles display only mild deviations from a flat-top shape. (c)\nThe profile shape can be used to constrain the colliding wind bow shock opening\nangle. (d) Structure in the line profile tends to be suppressed in binaries of\nshorter periods. (e) Obtaining data for multiple forbidden lines is important\nsince different lines probe different characteristic radial scales. Our models\nare discussed in relation to ISO data for WR 147 and gamma Vel (WR11). The\nlines for WR 147 are probably not accurate enough to draw firm conclusions. For\ngamma Vel, individual line morphologies are broadly reproducible but not\nsimultaneously so for the claimed wind and orbital parameters.

Among the proposed mechanisms to explain the kink mode\ndamping, resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum seems to be the most\nefficient as it produces damping times of about 3 periods. However, for a\nnonzero-beta plasma and typical prominence conditions, the kink mode is also\nresonantly coupled to slow (or cusp) continuum modes, which could further\nreduce the damping time. In this Letter, we explore for the first time both\nanalytically and numerically the effect of the slow continuum on the damping of\ntransverse thread oscillations.

Energy is transported by a large-scale, steady\ncirculation carrying high entropy matter from the primary to secondary\ncomponent. The circulation is driven by the baroclinic structure of the common\nenvelope, which is a direct consequence of the nonuniform heating at the inner\ncritical Roche lobes due to unequal emergent energy fluxes of the components.\nThe mass stream flowing around the secondary is bound to the equatorial region\nby the Coriolis force and its width is determined primarily by the flow\nvelocity. Its bottom is separated from the underlying secondary's convection\nzone by a radiative transition layer acting as an insulator. For a typically\nobserved degree of contact the heat capacity of the stream matter is much\nlarger than radiative losses during its flow around the secondary. As a result,\nits effective temperature and entropy decrease very little before it returns to\nthe primary. The existence of the stream changes insignificantly specific\nentropies of both convective envelopes and sizes of the components. Substantial\noversize of the secondaries, required by the Roche geometry, cannot be\nexplained in this way.

We find that we can reproduce a reasonable CV\nmass-transfer rate, and that our extended atmosphere gives a separation that is\ntoo large by aproximately 16%, although its pressure scale height is\nconsiderably exaggerated. We use the technique to measure the semi-major axis\nrequired for the onset of mass transfer in binaries with a mass ratio of q=0.6\nand a range of eccentricities.

Reconnection is the only mechanism by which magnetic fields can\nglobally restructure, enabling them to access a lower energy state. Over the\npast decade, there have been some major advances in our understanding of\nthree-dimensional reconnection. In particular, the key characteristics of 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) reconnection have been determined. For instance, 3D\nreconnection (i) occurs with or without nulls, (ii) occurs continuously and\ncontinually throughout a diffusion region and (iii) is driven by counter\nrotating flows.\n  Furthermore, analysis of resistive 3D MHD magnetic experiments have revealed\nsome intriguing effects relating to where and how reconnection occurs. To\nillustrate these new features, a series of constant-resistivity experiments,\ninvolving the interaction of two opposite-polarity magnetic sources in an\noverlying field, are considered. Such a simple interaction represents a typical\nbuilding block of the Sun's magnetic atmosphere. By following the evolution of\nthe magnetic topology, we are able to explain where, how and at what rate the\nreconnection occurs. Remarkably there can be up to five energy release sites at\nanyone time (compared to one in the potential case) and the duration of the\ninteraction increases (more than doubles) as the resistivity decreases (by a\nfactor of 16). The decreased resistivity also leads to a higher peak ohmic\ndissipation and more energy being released in total, as a result of a greater\ninjection of Poynting flux.\n", "authors": "Clare E.

The circumstellar envelopes are assumed to be spherically\nsymmetric and formed by a constant mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates are\nestimated from fitting the CO observations using a non-local, non-LTE radiative\ntransfer code. Once the physical properties of the circumstellar envelopes are\ndetermined, the same radiative transfer code is used to model the observed SiO\nlines in order to derive circumstellar abundances and the sizes of the SiO\nline-emitting regions.

AIMS: After\ninvestigating the solar oxygen abundance using a CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical\nsolar model in previous work, we undertake a similar approach studying the\nsolar abundance of nitrogen, since this element accounts for a significant\nfraction of the overall solar metallicity, Z. METHOD: We used a selection of\natomic spectral lines to determine the solar nitrogen abundance, relying mainly\non equivalent width measurements in the literature. We investigate the\ninfluence on the abundance analysis, of both deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (\"NLTE effects\") and photospheric inhomogeneities\n(\"granulation effects\"). RESULTS: We recommend use of a solar nitrogen\nabundance of A(N)=7.86+-0.12 whose error bar reflects the line-to-line scatter.\nCONCLUSION: The solar metallicity implied by the CO5BOLD-based nitrogen and\noxygen abundances is in the range 0.0145<= Z <= 0.0167.

The study shows\nthat primordial binary evolution may produce blue stragglers at any given times\nand that different evolutionary channels are corresponding for blue stragglers\nin different visual magnitude regions (in V band) on the colour-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) of clusters. The specific frequency of blue stragglers obtained\nfrom primordial binary evolution decreases with time first, and then increases\nagain when the age is larger than 10Gyr, while that from angular momentum loss\ninduced by magnetic braking in low-mass binaries increases with time and\nexceeds that of primordial binary evolution in a population older than 3 Gyr.\nMeanwhile, blue stragglers resulting from primordial binary evolution are\ndominant contributors to the ISEDs in ultraviolet and blue bands in a\npopulation between 0.3 and 2.0 Gyr. The value of $\\beta$ significantly affects\non the final results. For old open clusters, the assumption of $\\beta =1$ when\nthe primary is in HG at the onset of mass transfer matches the observations\nbetter than that of $\\beta =0.5$ from the locations of BSs on the CMDs.

The line-ratio technique that was developed in the early 1970s\nrevealed a picture where most flux that we see in magnetograms originates in\nhighly bundled, kG fields with a tiny volume filling factor.

Although these disks seem to be ejected from the\nstar and not accreted, there is substantial observational evidence to show that\nthe stars rotate more slowly than required for centrifugally driven mass loss.\nThis paper develops an idea (proposed originally by Hiroyasu Ando and\ncolleagues) that nonradial stellar pulsations inject enough angular momentum\ninto the upper atmosphere to spin up a Keplerian disk. The pulsations\nthemselves are evanescent in the stellar photosphere, but they may be unstable\nto the generation of resonant oscillations at the acoustic cutoff frequency. A\ndetailed theory of the conversion from pulsations to resonant waves does not\nyet exist for realistic hot-star atmospheres, so the current models depend on a\nparameterized approximation for the efficiency of wave excitation. Once\nresonant waves have been formed, however, they grow in amplitude with\nincreasing height, steepen into shocks, and exert radial and azimuthal Reynolds\nstresses on the mean fluid. Using reasonable assumptions for the stellar\nparameters, these processes were found to naturally create the inner boundary\nconditions required for dense Keplerian disks, even when the underlying B-star\nphotosphere is rotating as slowly as 60% of its critical rotation speed.\nBecause there is evidence for long-term changes in Be-star pulsational\nproperties, this model may also account for the long-term variability of Be\nstars, including transitions between normal, Be, and shell phases.\n", "authors": "Steven R.

The physical implication of large blue shift of Ne viii in the quiet\nSun region is investigated in this paper. Methods. We compare the significant\nNe viii blue shifts, which are visible as large blue patches on the\nDoppler-shift map of a middlelatitude quiet-Sun region observed by SUMER, with\nthe coronal magnetic-field structures as reconstructed from a simultaneous\nphotospheric magnetogram by means of a force-free-field extrapolation. Results.\nWe show for the first time that coronal funnels also exist in the quiet Sun.\nThe region studied contains several small funnels that originate from network\nlanes, expand with height and finally merge into a single wide open-field\nregion. However, the large blue shifts of the Ne viii line are not generally\nassociated with funnels. A comparison between the projections of coronal loops\nonto the solar x-y-plane and the Ne viii dopplergram indicates that there are\nsome loops that reveal large Ne viii blue shifts in both legs, and some loops\nwith upflow in one and downflow in the other leg. Conclusions. Our results\nsuggest that strong plasma outflow, which can be traced by large Ne viii blue\nshift, is not necessarily associated with the solar wind originating in coronal\nfunnels but appears to be a signature of mass supply to coronal loops. Under\nthe assumption that the measured Doppler shift of the Ne viii line represents\nthe real outflow velocity of the neon ions being markers of the proton flow, we\nestimate the mass supply rate to coronal loops to be about 10\\^{34} s\\^{-1}.\n", "authors": "H.

We discuss the problems of\n``measuring'' mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of the near\ninfrared, Br-alpha line as a tool to enable a more precise quantification, and\ncomment on physical explanations for mass-loss rates that are much lower than\npredicted by the standard model.\n  Wind clumping, conventionally interpreted as the consequence of a strong\ninstability inherent to radiative line-driving, has severe implications for the\ninterpretation of observational diagnostics, since derived mass-loss rates are\nusually overestimated when clumping is present but ignored in the analyses.\nSimplified techniques to account for clumping indicate overestimates by factors\nof 2 to 10, or even more. If actually true, these results would have a dramatic\nimpact on the evolution of, and the feedback from, massive stars. We discuss\nongoing attempts (including own work) to interprete the corresponding\nobservations in terms of more sophisticated models. By allowing for porosity in\ndensity and velocity space, and for a non-void inter-clump medium, such models\nmight require only moderate reductions of mass-loss rates.\n", "authors": "J. Puls, J. O.

This is the first detection of a magnetic cycle for a star other than\nthe Sun. The role of the close-in massive planet in the short activity cycle of\nthe star is questioned.\n  Tau Boo has strong differential rotation, a common trend for stars with\nshallow convective envelope. At latitude 40 deg., the surface layer of the star\nrotates in 3.31 d, equal to the orbital period. Synchronization suggests that\nthe tidal effects induced by the planet may be strong enough to force at least\nthe thin convective envelope into corotation. Tau Boo shows variability in the\nCa H & K and Halpha throughout the night and on a night to night time scale. We\ndo not detect enhancement in the activity of the star that may be related to\nthe conjunction of the planet. Further data is needed to conclude about the\nactivity enhancement due to the planet.\n", "authors": "R. Fares, J. -F. Donati, C. Moutou, D. Bohlender, C. Catala, M. Deleuil, E. Shkolnik, A. C.

The emission levels in the Calcium\ninfrared triplet lines were then used as a measure of the chromospheric\nactivity of the stars. When plotted against Rossby number (NR) the star's\nchromospheric emission levels show a plateau in the emission for Log(NR) < -1.1\nindicating chromospheric saturation similar to the coronal saturation seen in\npreviously observed X-ray emission from the same stars. However, unlike the\ncoronal emission, the chromospheric emission of the stars show little evidence\nof a reduction in emission (i.e. supersaturation) for the ultra-rapid rotators\nin the clusters. Thus we believe that coronal supersaturation is not the result\nof an overall decrease in magnetic dynamo efficiency for ultra-rapid rotators.\n", "authors": "S. C. Marsden, B. D. Carter, J. -F.

We use the\nwell-established techniques of stellar population modeling to age-date the\nstars surrounding the site of the recent transient event in NGC 300 (NGC 300\nOT2008-1). The surrounding stars must share a common turnoff mass with the\ntransient, since almost all stars form in stellar clusters that remain\nphysically associated for periods longer than the lifetime of the most massive\nstars. We find that the precursor of NGC 300 OT2008-1 is surrounded by stars\nthat formed in a single burst between 8-13 Myr ago, with 70% confidence. The\ntransient was therefore likely to be due to a progenitor whose mass falls\nbetween the main sequence turnoff mass (12 Msun) and the maximum stellar mass\n(25 Msun) found for isochrones bounding this age range. We characterize the\ngeneral applicability of this technique in identifying precursor masses of\nhistoric and future transients and supernovae (SNe), noting that it requires\nneither precursor imaging nor sub-arcsecond accuracy in the position of the\ntransient. It is also based on the well-understood physics of the main\nsequence, and thus may be a more reliable source of precursor masses than\nfitting evolutionary tracks to precursor magnitudes. We speculate that if the\nprogenitor mass is close to 17 Msun, there may be a connection between optical\ntransients such as NGC 300 OT2008-1 and the missing type II-P SNe, known as the\n\"red supergiant problem.\"\n", "authors": "Stephanie M.

The self-reversal\ndepths of the Ly-a and Ly-b profiles are quantified by measuring the maximum\nspectral radiances of the two horns and the minimum spectral radiance of the\ncentral reversal. The information on the asymmetries of the Ly-a and Ly-b\nprofiles is obtained through the calculation of the 1st and 3rd-order moments\nof the line profiles. We find that the emissions of the Lyman lines tend to be\nmore strongly absorbed in the internetwork, as compared to those in the network\nregion. Almost all of the Ly-a profiles are self-reversed, whilst about 17% of\nthe Ly-b profiles are not reversed. The ratio of Ly-a and Ly-b intensities\nseems to be independent of the magnetic field strength. Most Ly-a profiles are\nstronger in the blue horn, while most Ly-b profiles are stronger in the red\nhorn. However, the opposite asymmetries of Ly-a and Ly-b are not pixel-to-pixel\ncorrelated. We also confirm that when larger transition-region downflows are\npresent, the Ly-a and Ly-b profiles are more enhanced in the blue and red\nhorns, respectively. The first-order moment of Ly-b, which reflects the\ncombined effects of the profile asymmetry and motion of the emitting material,\nstrongly correlates with the Doppler shifts of the Si iii and O vi lines,\nwhilst for Ly-a this correlation is much weaker. Our analysis shows that both\nLy-a and Ly-b might be more redshifted if larger transition-region downflows\nare present.

We locate the source of the water\nmaser outflow at the position of the compact mid-IR peak of source G (source\nG:IRS1). This IR source is not coincident with any identified compact radio\ncontinuum source, but is coincident with a hot molecular core, so we propose\nthat G:IRS1 is a hot core driving an outflow analogous to the wide-angle\nbipolar outflow in OMC-1. G:IRS1 is at the origin of a larger bipolar cavity\nand CO outflow. The water maser outflow is orthogonal to the bipolar CO cavity,\nso the masers probably reside near its waist in the cavity walls. Models of the\nIR emission require a massive protostar of 45Msun, 3e5Lsun, and an effective\nenvelope accretion rate of 1e-3Msun/yr. Feedback from the central star could\npotentially drive the H2O maser outflow, but it has insufficient radiative\nmomentum to have driven the large-scale CO outflow, requiring that this massive\nstar had an active accretion disk over the past 10^4 yr.

For 11 of them, we confirm the presence of disks\nbased on Spitzer/IRAC photometry. The effective temperatures for the brown\ndwarf sample range from 2500K to 3000K, which translates to masses of ~0.015 to\n0.1Ms. For comparison, the completeness limit of our survey translates to mass\nlimits of 0.004Ms for Av<~5mag or 0.008Ms for Av<~ 10mag. Compared with other\nstar-forming regions, NGC1333 shows an overabundance of brown dwarfs relative\nto low-mass stars, by a factor of 2-5. On the other hand, NGC1333 has a deficit\nof planetary-mass objects: Based on the surveys in SOrionis, the ONC and Cha I,\nthe expected number of planetary-mass objects in NGC1333 is 8-10, but we find\nnone. It is plausible that our survey has detected the minimum mass limit for\nstar formation in this particular cluster, at around 0.012-0.02Ms. If\nconfirmed, our findings point to significant regional/environmental differences\nin the number of brown dwarfs and the minimum mass of the IMF.

Recently, three hot DQ white\ndwarfs have been reported to exhibit photometric variability with periods\ncompatible with pulsation g-modes. Here, we present a nonadiabatic pulsation\nanalysis of the recently discovered carbon-rich hot DQ white dwarf stars. One\nof our main aims is to test the convective-mixing picture for the origin of hot\nDQs through the pulsational properties. Our study relies on the full\nevolutionary models of hot DQ white dwarfs recently developed by Althaus et al.\n(2009), that consistently cover the whole evolution from the born-again stage\nto the white dwarf cooling track. Specifically, we present a stability analysis\nof white dwarf models from stages before the blue edge of the DBV instability\nstrip until the domain of the hot DQ white dwarfs, including the transition DB\n--> hot DQ white dwarf. We found that at evolutionary phases in which the\nmodels are characterized by He-dominated atmospheres, they exhibit unstable\n$g$-mode pulsations typical of DBV stars, and when the models become DQ white\ndwarfs with carbon-dominated atmospheres, they continue being pulsationally\nunstable with similar characteristics than DB models, and in agreement with the\nperiods detected in variable hot DQ white dwarfs. Our calculations provide\nstrong support to the convective-mixing picture for the formation of hot DQs.\nIn particular, our results point to the existence of pulsating DB white dwarfs\nwith very thin He-rich envelopes, which after passing the DBV instability strip\nbecome variable hot DQ stars. The existence of these DB stars with very thin\nenvelopes could be investigated through asteroseismology.\n", "authors": "A. H. C\u00f3rsico, A. D. Romero, L. G. Althaus, E.

Two separations of the\nflare ribbons are associated with these two sideward motions, with average\nvelocities of 3.3 and 1.3 km/s, separately. Using the observation of\nphotospheric magnetic field, the velocities of the sideward motions and the\nseparations, we deduce the corresponding coronal magnetic field strength to be\nabout 13.2-15.2 G, and estimate the reconnection rates to be 0.05 and 0.02 for\nthese two magnetic reconnection processes, respectively.

The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the\nstages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.\nDowndrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star\n\"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find\nthat the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by\nextension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI\nmotions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz\nafter bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are\nset by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy\nfrequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the GW\ncharacteristic frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure\nattributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details\nthat determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate\nhistory, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport.

Each radius in the hot flow\nproduces fluctuations, and we further assume that these are damped on the\nviscous frequency. Integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noise\npower between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscous\ntimescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.\nLense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes the\nlow frequency QPO on this continuum power.\n  We test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems\n(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) kHz QPO most likely\nindependently tracks the truncation radius. These show that this model can give\na consistent solution, with the truncation radius decreasing from 20-8 Rg while\nthe inner radius of the flow remains approximately constant at ~4.5 Rg i.e. 9.2\nkm. We use this very constrained geometry to predict the low frequency QPO from\nLense-Thirring precession of the entire hot flow from r_o to r_i. The simplest\nassumption of a constant surface density in the hot flow matches the observed\nQPO frequency to within 25 per cent. This match can be made even better by\nconsidering that the surface density should become increasingly centrally\nconcentrated as the flow collapses into an optically thick boundary layer\nduring the spectral transition.

The\nobservations at the first epoch were used as inputs to model the geometry and\nkinematic structure of the evolving RS Oph nebular remnant. We find that the\nmodeled remnant comprises two distinct co-aligned bipolar components; a\nlow-velocity, high-density innermost (hour glass) region and a more extended,\nhigh-velocity (dumbbell) structure. This overall structure is in agreement with\nthat deduced from radio observations and optical interferometry at earlier\nepochs. We find that the asymmetry observed in the west lobe is an instrumental\neffect caused by the profile of the HST filter and hence demonstrate that this\nlobe is approaching the observer. We then conclude that the system has an\ninclination to the line of sight of 39$^{+1}_{-10}$ degrees. This is in\nagreement with the inclination of the binary orbit and lends support to the\nproposal that this morphology is due to the interaction of the outburst ejecta\nwith either an accretion disk around the central white dwarf and/or a\npre-existing red giant wind that is significantly denser in the equatorial\nregions of the binary than at the poles.

For\n20 objects covering masses from 0.05 to 0.5 Msol we detect a periodic flux\nmodulation, indicating the presence of magnetic spots co-rotating with the\nobjects. The detection rate of photometric periods (~20%) is significantly\nlower than in solar-mass stars at the same age, which points to a mass\ndependence in the spot properties. With two exceptions, none of the objects\nexhibit variability and thus spot activity in more than one season. This is\ncontrary to what is seen in solar-mass stars and indicates that spot\nconfigurations capable of producing photometric modulations occur relatively\nrarely and are transient in VLM objects. The rotation periods derived in this\npaper range from 3 to 30h, arguing for a lack of slow rotators among VLM\nobjects. The periods fit into a rotational evolution scenario with pre-main\nsequence contraction and moderate (40-50%) angular momentum losses due to wind\nbraking. By combining our findings with literature results, we identify two\nregimes of rotational and magnetic properties, called C- and I-sequence. Main\nproperties on the C-sequence are fast rotation, weak wind braking, Halpha\nemission, and saturated activity levels, while the I-sequence is characterised\nby slow rotation, strong wind braking, no Halpha emission, and linear\nactivity-rotation relationship.

Violent\nconvective overturn in the post-shock layer causes the explosion to start with\nsignificant asphericity, which triggers the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)\ninstabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star. Deep inward\nmixing of hydrogen (H) is found as well as fast-moving, metal-rich clumps\npenetrating with high velocities far into the H-envelope of the star as\nobserved, e.g., in the case of SN 1987A. Also individual clumps containing a\nsizeable fraction of the ejected iron-group elements (up to several 0.001 solar\nmasses) are obtained in some models.

We use the complete formalism of\nICS to calculate X-ray fluxes from possible populations of flare primary\nelectrons and secondary positrons, paying attention to the incident photon\nangular distribution near the solar surface and thus improving on the\nassumption of isotropy made in previous solar discussions. Both primary\nelectrons and secondary positrons produce very hard ICS X-ray spectra. The\nanisotropic primary radiation field results in pronounced centre-to-limb\nvariation in predicted fluxes and spectra, with the most intense spectra,\nextending to the highest photon energies, expected from limb flares. Acceptable\nnumbers of electrons or positrons could account for RHESSI coronal X/gamma-ray\nsources. Some coronal X-ray sources at least might be interpreted in terms of\nICS by relativistic electrons or positrons, particularly when sources appear at\nsuch low ambient densities that bremsstrahlung appears implausible.\n", "authors": "Alec L.

A number of researchers have\npointed out the possibilities of breaking degeneracies between Omega_Matter and\nH0 if there is a CMB independent distance scale accurate to a few percent (Hu\n2005). Current uncertainties in the distance scale are about 10% but future\nobservations, with, for example, the JWST, will be capable of estimating H0 to\nwithin a few percent. A crucial step in this process is the Cepheid PL\nrelation. Recent evidence has emerged that the PL relation, at least in optical\nbands, is nonlinear and that neglect of such a nonlinearity can lead to errors\nin estimating H0 of up to 2 percent. Hence it is important to critically\nexamine this possible nonlinearity both observationally and theoretically.\nExisting PC/PL relations rely exclusively on evaluating these relations at mean\nlight. However, since such relations are the average of relations at different\nphases. Here we report on recent attempts to compare theory and observation in\nthe multiphase PC/PL planes. We construct state of the art Cepheid pulsations\nmodels appropriate for the LMC/Galaxy and compare the resulting PC/PL relations\nas a function of phase with observations. For the LMC, the (V-I) period-color\nrelation at minimum light can have quite a narrow dispersion (0.2-0.3 mags) and\nthus could be useful in placing constraints on models. At longer periods, the\nmodels predict significantly redder (by about 0.2-0.3 mags) V-I colors. We\ndiscuss possible reasons for this and also compare PL relations at various\nphases of pulsation and find clear evidence in both theory and observations for\na nonlinear PL relation.\n", "authors": "S.

We find that, in the absence of regulation by magnetic\nfields and outflow feedback, massive stars form readily in a turbulent,\nmoderately condensed clump of $\\sim 1,600$ solar masses, along with a cluster\nof hundreds of lower mass stars. The massive stars are fed at high rates by (1)\ntransient dense filaments produced by large-scale turbulent compression at\nearly times, and (2) by the clump-wide global collapse resulting from\nturbulence decay at late times. In both cases, the bulk of the massive star's\nmass is supplied from outside a 0.1 pc-sized \"core\" that surrounds the star. In\nour simulation, the massive star is clump-fed rather than core-fed. The need\nfor large-scale feeding makes the massive star formation prone to regulation by\noutflow feedback, which directly opposes the feeding processes. The outflows\nreduce the mass accretion rates onto the massive stars by breaking up the dense\nfilaments that feed the massive star formation at early times, and by\ncollectively slowing down the global collapse that fuel the massive star\nformation at late times. The latter is aided by a moderate magnetic field of\nstrength in the observed range.

After identifying\nand rejecting the systems that are known to be affected by systematic errors\n(due to further multiplicity or obscuration by circumstellar material), we find\nthat the relative binary ages, |Delta log(tau)|, have an overall dispersion of\nsigma~0.40 dex. Random pairs of Taurus members are coeval only to within\nsigma~0.58 dex, indicating that Taurus binaries are indeed more coeval than the\nassociation as a whole. However, the distribution of |Delta log(tau)| suggests\ntwo populations, with ~2/3 of the sample appearing coeval to within the errors\n(sigma~0.16 dex) and the other ~1/3 distributed in an extended tail reaching\n|Delta log(tau)|~0.4-0.9 dex. To explain the finding of a multi-peaked\ndistribution, we suggest that the tail of the differential age distribution\nincludes unrecognized hierarchical multiples, stars seen in scattered light, or\nstars with disk contamination; additional followup is required to rule out or\ncorrect for these explanations. The relative coevality of binary systems does\nnot depend significantly on the system mass, mass ratio, or separation.

When the mass-accretion rate is low\n(\\dot M_{acc} < a few \\times 10^{-7} M_\\sun yr^{-1}), hydrogen nuclear burning\nis unstable and nova outbursts occur. A nova is a transient supersoft X-ray\nsource (SSS) in its later phase which timescale depends strongly on the WD\nmass. The X-ray turn on/off time is a good indicator of the WD mass. At an\nintermediate mass-accretion rate an accreting WD becomes a persistent SSS with\nsteady hydrogen burning. For a higher mass-accretion rate, the WD undergoes\n\"accretion wind evolution\" in which the WD accretes matter from the equatorial\nplane and loses mass by optically thick winds from the other directions. Two\nSSS, namely RX J 0513-69 and V Sge, are corresponding objects to this accretion\nwind evolution.

This grid of models covers most of\nthe expected combinations of stellar parameters, which are made up of the\nstellar temperature, the stellar luminosity, the stellar mass, the abundance of\ncondensible carbon, and the velocity amplitude of the pulsation. The resultant\nmass-loss rates and wind speeds are clearly affected by the choice of stellar\ntemperature, mass, luminosity and the abundance of available carbon. In certain\nparts of the parameter space there is also an inevitable mass-loss threshold,\nbelow which a dust-driven wind is not possible. Contrary to some previous\nstudies, we find a strong dependence on the abundance of free carbon, which\nturns out to be a critical parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the dust\ngrains that form in the atmosphere may grow too large for the commonly used\nsmall particle approximation of the dust opacity to be strictly valid. This may\nhave some bearing on the wind properties, although further study of this\nproblem is needed before quantitative conclusions can be drawn. The wind\nproperties show relatively simple dependences on stellar parameters above the\nmass-loss threshold, while the threshold itself is of a more complicated\nnature. Hence, we chose not to derive any simplistic mass-loss formula, but\nrather provide a mass-loss prescription in the form of an easy-to-use FORTRAN\nroutine. Since this mass-loss routine is based on data coming from an\nessentially self-consistent model of mass loss, it may therefore serve as a\nbetter mass-loss prescription for stellar evolution calculations than empirical\nformulae.

We\npresent the distributions of the masses, $M_{\\rm 2}^{\\rm SN}$, the radii,\n$R_{\\rm 2}^{\\rm SN}$, of companions, and the periods, $P_{\\rm SN}$, and the\nratios of separations to radii, $A/R_{\\rm 2}^{\\rm SN}$, of WD + MS systems for\nvarious $Z$ at the moment of supernova explosion. These arameters can be\napplied to constrain the numerical simulation of the interaction between the\nejecta of a supernova and its companion. We also show the distributions of some\nintegral properties of companions, i.e. the mass, the space velocity and the\nsurface gravity, for various $Z$ after the interaction. The distributions may\nhelp to search companion in a supernova remnant. All the parameters above\nsignificantly change with $Z$. Incorporating the simulation results of\ninteraction between supernovae ejecta and companions in Marietta et al. (2000)\nand Kasen et al. (2004) into our binary population synthesis study, we found\nthat more than 75% of all supernovae have enough polarization signal which can\nbe detected by spectropolarimetric observations. We also found that 13 to 14\nper cent SNe Ia belong to the supernovae like 1991T, which is consistent with\nobservations within errors. This may indicate that SNe 1991T-like have not any\nspecial properties in physics except for the viewing angle of an observer.\n", "authors": "Xiangcun Meng, Wuming Yang"}, {"category": "astro-ph.SR", "pubdate": "2009-09-11T14:27:55Z", "title": "NLTE analysis of Co I/Co II lines in spectra of cool stars with new\n  laboratory hyperfine splitting constants", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2178v1", "summary": "  We investigate the statistical equilibrium of Co in the atmospheres of cool\nstars, and the influence of NLTE and HFS (hyperfine splitting) on the formation\nof Co lines and abundances.

To\nthis end, we model the boundary-driven kinematic emergence of a compact,\nintense, and uniformly twisted flux tube into a potential field arcade that\noverlies a weakly twisted coronal flux rope. The expansion of the emerging flux\nin the corona gives rise to the formation of a nullpoint at the interface of\nthe emerging and the pre-existing fields. We unveil a two-step reconnection\nprocess at the nullpoint that eventually yields the formation of a broad 3D\nfan-spine configuration above the emerging bipole. The first reconnection\ninvolves emerging fields and a set of large-scale arcade field lines. It\nresults in the launch of a torsional MHD wave that propagates along the\narcades, and in the formation of a sheared loop system on one side of the\nemerging flux. The second reconnection occurs between these newly formed loops\nand remote arcade fields, and yields the formation of a second loop system on\nthe opposite side of the emerging flux. The two loop systems collectively\ndisplay an anenome pattern that is located below the fan surface.

With its focus on particularly cool photospheres this\ncatalogue serves as a companion to recent spectroscopic atlases of MK standards\nin the near-IR.

The axis of the tube never\nfully emerges as dense plasma becomes trapped in magnetic dips and restrains\nits ascent.

Based on these calculations, we also\nsimulate the time evolution of thermal emission from the shock-heated dust in\nthe SNR and compare the results with the observations of Cas A SNR. We find\nthat the total mass of dust formed in the SN IIb is as large as 0.167 M_sun but\nthe average radius of dust is smaller than 0.01 mum and is significantly\ndifferent from those in SNe II-P with the massive H-envelope. In the explosion\nwith the small-mass H-envelope, the expanding He core undergoes little\ndeceleration, so that the gas density in the He core is too low for large-sized\ngrains to form. In addition, the low-mass H-envelope of the SN IIb leads to the\nearly arrival of the reverse shock at the dust-forming region. If the CSM is\nmore or less spherical, therefore, the newly formed grains would be completely\ndestroyed in the relatively dense shocked gas for the CSM density of n_H > 0.1\ncm^{-3}. However, the actual CSM is likely to be non-spherical, so that a part\nof grains could be ejected into the ISM without being shocked. We demonstrate\nthat the time evolution of the SED by thermal dust emission is sensitive to the\nambient gas density and structure that affects the passage of the reverse shock\ninto the ejecta. Thus, the SED evolution well reflects the evolution of dust\nthrough erosion by sputtering and stochastic heating. For Cas A, we consider\nthe CSM produced by the steady mass loss of ~8x10^{-5} M_sun/yr during the\nsupergiant phase. Then we find the infrared SED of Cas A is reasonably\nreproduced by thermal emission from the newly formed dust of 0.08 M_sun, which\nconsists of 0.008 M_sun shocked warm dust and 0.072 M_sun unshocked cold dust.\n", "authors": "Takaya Nozawa, Takashi Kozasa, Nozomu Tominaga, Keiichi Maeda, Hideyuki Umeda, Ken'ichi Nomoto, Oliver Krause"}, {"category": "astro-ph.SR", "pubdate": "2009-09-23T11:12:55Z", "title": "Bolometric luminosity variations in the Luminous Blue Variable AFGL2298", "idurl": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4160v1", "summary": "  We characterise the variability in the physical properties of the luminous\nblue variable AFGL2298 between 1989-2008.

We present a\nmethod to make such quantitative use of X-Ray and EUV images of coronal loops.\nEach individual loop is fit to a field line of a linear force-free field,\nallowing the estimation of the field line's twist, three-dimensional geometry\nand the field strength along it.\n  We assess the validity of such a reconstruction since the actual corona is\nprobably not a linear force-free field and that the superposition of linear\nforce-free fields is generally not itself a force-free field. To do so, we\nperform a series of tests on non-linear force-free fields, described in Low &\nLou (1990). For model loops we project field lines onto the photosphere. We\ncompare several results of the method with the original field, in particular\nthe three-dimensional loop shapes, local twist (coronal alpha), distribution of\ntwist in the model photosphere and strength of the magnetic field.

The light curves are complex and suggest multiple\nperiods, changing periods, and/or changing amplitudes, which are attributed to\npulsation. A dominant period has been determined for each and found to be in\nthe range of ~150 d for the coolest (G8) to 35-40 d for the warmest (F3). A\nclear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the\npulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse linear\nrelationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective\ntemperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-AGB\nstar evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published\nspectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to\nhave cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that\nintensive mass loss ended a few thousand years ago. The detection of periods as\nlong as 150 d in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution\nmodels that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume\nthat intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100\nd. This revision will have the effect of extending the time scale for the early\nphases of post-AGB evolution. It appears that real time evolution in the\npulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the time scale of\ntwo decades.\n", "authors": "Bruce J. Hrivnak, Wenxian Lu, Richard E.

On the basis of new and updated sets of\nevolutionary and pulsational models, we quantitatively evaluated the effects on\nthe theoretical PL relation of current uncertainties on the chemical abundances\nof Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and on several physical assumptions\nadopted in the evolutionary models. We analysed how the different factors\ninfluence the evolutionary and pulsational observables and the resulting PL\nrelation. As a result, we found that present uncertainties on the most relevant\nH and He burning reaction rates do not influence in a relevant way the loop\nextension in temperature. On the contrary, current uncertainties on the LMC\nchemical composition significantly affect the loop extension and also reflect\nin the morphology of the instability strip; however their influence on the\npredicted pulsational parameters is negligible. We also discussed how\novershooting and mass loss influence the ML relation and the pulsational\nparameters. In summary, the present uncertainties on the physical inputs\nadopted in the evolutionary codes and in the LMC chemical composition are\nnegligible for the prediction of the main pulsational properties; the inclusion\nof overshooting in the previous H burning phase and/or of mass loss is expected\nto significantly change the resulting theoretical pulsational scenario for\nCepheids, as well as the calibration of their distance scale.

To reconcile investigations of\ndifferent diagnostics within such models, a highly clumped wind with very low\nmass-loss rates needs to be invoked. Particularly, unsaturated UV resonance\nlines seem to indicate rates an order of magnitude (or even more) lower than\npreviously accepted values. We investigate resonance line formation in\ninhomogeneous hot star winds with non-monotonic velocity fields by means of 2D\nstochastic and pseudo-2D radiation-hydrodynamic wind models. A Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer code is presented and used to produce synthetic line\nspectra. Results: The optically thin clumping limit is only valid for very weak\nlines. For intermediate strong lines, the velocity spans of the clumps are of\ncentral importance. Current hydrodynamical models predict spans that are too\nlarge to reproduce observed profiles unless a very low mass-loss rate is\ninvoked. By simulating lower spans in 2D stochastic models, the profile\nstrengths become drastically reduced, and are consistent with higher mass-loss\nrates. To simultaneously meet the constraints from strong lines, the\ninter-clump medium must be non-void. A first comparison to the observed PV\ndoublet in the O6 supergiant lam Cep confirms that a stochastic 2D model\nreproduces observations with a mass-loss rate roughly ten times higher than\nthat derived from the same lines but assuming optically thin clumping.\nTentatively this may resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions,\nevolutionary constraints, and recent derived mass-loss rates, and suggests a\nre-investigation of the structure predicted by current hydrodynamical models.\n", "authors": "J.

The resulting magnetic field depends strongly on the electrical\nconductivity of the white dwarf, the lifetime of the convective envelope and\nthe variability of the magnetic dynamo. We assess the various energy sources\navailable and estimate necessary lifetimes of the common envelope. In the case\nof a dynamo that leads a randomly oriented magnetic field we find that the\ninduced field is confined to a thin boundary layer at the surface of the white\ndwarf. This then decays away rapidly upon dispersal of the common envelope. The\nresidual field is typically less than 10^-8 times the strength of the external\nfield. Only in the case where there is some preferential direction to the\ndynamo-generated field can an induced field, that avoids rapid decay, be\nproduced. We show that a surface field of magnitude a few per cent of the\nexternal field may be produced after a few Myr. In this case the residual field\nstrength is roughly proportional to the lifetime of the dynamo activity.\n", "authors": "Adrian T. Potter, Christopher A.

The best methods are then compared to\npublished temperatures using the Zanstra method and assessed for their ability\nto reflect central star effective temperatures and evolution. As a result we\ncall for a clarification of the term `excitation class' according to the\ndifferent input parameters used. The first method, which we refer to as Exneb\nrelies purely on the ratios of certain key emission lines. The second method,\nwhich we refer to as Ex* includes modeling to create a continuous variable and,\nfor optically thick PNe in the Magellanic Clouds, is designed to relate more\nclosely to intrinsic stellar parameters. The third method, we refer to as Ex\n[OIII]/H-beta since the [OIII]/H-beta ratio is used in isolation to other\ntemperature diagnostics.

Earlier work has suggested that large-scale dynamos can reach and\nmaintain equipartition field strengths on a dynamical time scale only if\nmagnetic helicity of the fluctuating field can be shed from the domain through\nopen boundaries. Aims. Our aim is to test this scenario in convection-driven\ndynamos by comparing results for open and closed boundary conditions. Methods.\nThree-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent compressible convection\nwith shear and rotation are used to study the effects of boundary conditions on\nthe excitation and saturation of large-scale dynamos. Open (vertical-field) and\nclosed (perfect-conductor) boundary conditions are used for the magnetic field.\nThe shear flow is such that the contours of shear are vertical, crossing the\nouter surface, and are thus ideally suited for driving a shear-induced magnetic\nhelicity flux. Results. We find that for given shear and rotation rate, the\ngrowth rate of the magnetic field is larger if open boundary conditions are\nused. The growth rate first increases for small magnetic Reynolds number, Rm,\nbut then levels off at an approximately constant value for intermediate values\nof Rm. For large enough Rm, a small-scale dynamo is excited and the growth rate\nof the field in this regime increases as Rm^(1/2). Regarding the nonlinear\nregime, the saturation level of the energy of the total magnetic field is\nindependent of Rm when open boundaries are used. In the case of perfect\nconductor boundaries, the saturation level first increases as a function of Rm,\nbut then decreases proportional to Rm^(-1) for Rm > 30, indicative of\ncatastrophic quenching. These results suggest that the shear-induced magnetic\nhelicity flux is efficient in alleviating catastrophic quenching when open\nboundaries are used.

The maximum radius of icy planets ranges from roughly 1500\nkm to 11,500 km. The formation rate of 1000 km objects - `Plutos' - is a useful\nproxy for the efficiency of icy planet formation. Plutos form more efficiently\nin massive disks, in disks with small planetesimals, and in disks with a range\nof planetesimal sizes. Although Plutos form throughout massive disks, Pluto\nproduction is usually concentrated in the inner disk. Despite the large number\nof Plutos produced in many calculations, icy planet formation is inefficient.\nAt the end of the main sequence lifetime of the central star, Plutos contain\nless than 10% of the initial mass in solid material. This conclusion is\nindependent of the initial mass in the disk or the properties of planetesimals.\nDebris disk formation coincides with the formation of planetary systems\ncontaining Plutos. As Plutos form, they stir leftover planetesimals to large\nvelocities. A cascade of collisions then grinds the leftovers to dust, forming\nan observable debris disk.

The same proportion is observed in reconstructions of\nthe open flux during the Holocene based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests\nthat the present solar minimum conditions are below average, but not\nexceptional in terms of the magnetic flux.\n", "authors": "L.

The facts that the system is magnetically active and that the\nhot spot has consistently existed on the inner hemisphere of the star indicate\nthat the two spots are formed by (1) magnetic dynamo-related activity on the\ncool star and (2) mass transfer from the primary to the secondary component.\nBased on 38 light-curve timings from the Wilson-Devinney code and all other\nminimum epochs, a period study of GW Cep reveals that the orbital period has\nexperienced a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 32.6 yrs\nand 0.009 d, respectively.

We explore in particular the metallicity dependence of\nmolecular cloud fragmentation and the possible variations in the dense core\nmass function, as the expression of a multi-phase ISM, due to dynamic and\nthermodynamic effects in starburst and metal-poor environments. To study the\nlevel of fragmentation during the collapse, the adaptive mesh refinement code\nFLASH is used. With this code, including self-gravity, thermal balance,\nturbulence and shocks, collapse is simulated with four different metallicity\ndependent cooling functions. Turbulent and rotational energies are considered\nas well. During the simulations, number densities of 10^8-10^9 cm^-3 are\nreached. The influences of dust and cosmic ray heating are investigated and a\ncomparison to isothermal cases is made. The presented results indicate that\nfragmentation increases with metallicity, while cosmic ray and gas-grain\ncollisional heating counteract this. We also find that modest rotation and\nturbulence can impact the cloud evolution as far as fragmentation is concerned.\nIn this light, we conclude that radiative feedback, in starburst regions, will\ninhibit fragmentation, while low-metallicity dwarfs also should enjoy a star\nformation mode in which fragmentation is suppressed.\n", "authors": "S.

While red giants exhibit\nlow surface rotational velocities, we find that the rotational history of the\nstar has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. In\nparticular, for stars massive enough to ignite He burning in non-degenerate\nconditions, rotational mixing induces a significant increase of the stellar\nluminosity and shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higher\nluminosity in the HR diagram. This of course results in a change of the seismic\nproperties of red giants at the same evolutionary state. As a consequence the\ninclusion of rotation significantly changes the fundamental parameters of a red\ngiant star as determined by performing an asteroseismic calibration. In\nparticular rotation decreases the derived stellar mass and increases the age.\nDepending on the rotation law assumed in the convective envelope and on the\ninitial velocity of the star, non-negligible values of rotational splitting can\nbe reached, which may complicate the observation and identification of\nnon-radial oscillation modes for red giants exhibiting moderate surface\nrotational velocities. By comparing the effects of rotation and overshooting,\nwe find that the main-sequence widening and the increase of the H-burning\nlifetime induced by rotation (Vini=150 km/s) are well reproduced by\nnon-rotating models with an overshooting parameter of 0.1, while the increase\nof luminosity during the post-main sequence evolution is better reproduced by\nnon-rotating models with overshooting parameters twice as large. This is due to\nthe fact that rotation not only increases the size of the convective core but\nalso changes the chemical composition of the radiative zone.\n", "authors": "P. Eggenberger, A.

We find that the appearance of deconfinement\nheating during spin-down result in not only the cooling delay but also the\nincrease of surface temperature of stars. For stars characterized by\nintermediate and weak magnetic field strength, a period of increasing surface\ntemperature could exist.

We resolved the L dwarf 2MASS J03105986+1648155 for the\nfirst time into two almost equally bright components straddling the L/T\ntransition. Since such a co-eval system with common age and composition\nprovides crucial information of this special transition phase, we monitored the\nsystem over 3 years to derive first orbital parameters and dynamical mass\nestimates, as well as a spectral type determination. We obtained resolved high\nangular resolution, near-IR images with HST and the adaptive optics instrument\nNACO at the VLT including the laser guide star system PARSEC. Based on two\nepochs of astrometric data we derive a minimum semi-major axis of 5.2 +- 0.8\nAU.

In particular, a recent study focusing on theta$ Oph has shown that\na convective core overshoot parameter of alpha = 0.44 is required to model the\nobserved pulsation frequencies, significantly higher than for other stars of\nthis type. We investigate the effects of rotation and overshoot in early type\nmain sequence pulsators, and attempt to use the low order pulsation frequencies\nto constrain these parameters. This will be applied to a few test models and\ntheta Oph. We use a 2D stellar evolution code and a 2D linear adiabatic\npulsation code to calculate pulsation frequencies for 9.5 Msun models. We\ncalculate low order p-modes for models with a range of rotation rates and\nconvective core overshoot parameters. Using these models, we find that the\nconvective core overshoot has a larger effect on the pulsation frequencies than\nthe rotation, except in the most rapidly rotating models considered. When the\ndifferences in radii are accounted for by scaling the frequencies, the effects\nof rotation diminish, but are not entirely accounted for. We find that\nincreasing the convective core overshoot decreases the large separation, while\nproducing a slight increase in the small separations. We created a model\nfrequency grid which spanned several rotation rates and convective core\novershoot values. Using a modified chi^2 statistic, we are able to recover the\nrotation velocity and core overshoot for a few test models. Finally, we discuss\nthe case of the beta Cephei star theta Oph.

In this work we show that some of these procedures\nhave problems and large uncertainties, and the real age of this star is still\nunknown, needing more observational constraints. Therefore, we have developed a\ncomprehensive modeling of HR8799, and taking advantage of its gamma\nDoradus-type pulsations, we have estimated the age of the star using\nasteroseismology. The accuracy in the age determination depends on the rotation\nvelocity of the star, and therefore an accurate value of the inclination angle\nis required to solve the problem.

We use a high-resolution\nideal MHD code to perform 2D and 3D local simulations of shear flows. Results.\nIn 2D, the magnetic field is amplified in less than 0.01ms until it reaches\nlocally equipartition with the kinetic energy. Subsequently, it saturates due\nto resistive instabilities that disrupt the KH vortex and decelerate the shear\nflow on a secular time scale. We determine scaling laws of the field\namplification with the initial field strength and the grid resolution. In 3D,\nthis hydromagnetic mechanism may be dominated by purely hydrodynamic\ninstabilities limiting the amplification. We find maximum magnetic fields of\n10^16 G locally, and r.m.s. maxima within the box of 10^15 G. However, such\nstrong fields exist only for a short period. In the saturated state, the\nmagnetic field is mainly oriented parallel to the shear flow for strong initial\nfields, while weaker initial fields tend to lead to a more balanced\ndistribution of the field energy. In all models the flow shows small-scale\nfeatures. The magnetic field is at most in equipartition with the decaying\nshear flow. (abridged)\n", "authors": "M. Obergaulinger, M. A. Aloy, E.

Standard analysis using a classical Kurucz model atmosphere and\nthe line analysis program MOOG provides the atmospheric parameters: Teff = 6500\nK, log g = +0.5, and a microturbulent velocity Vt = 4.7 km/s and [Fe/H] = -0.9.\nExtraction of these parameters is based on excitation of FeI lines, ionization\nequilibrium between neutral and ions of Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe, and the wings\nof hydrogen Paschen lines. Elemental abundances are obtained for 22 elements\nand upper limits for an additional four elements.

In the collapsing cloud, the\nfirst adiabatic core appears prior to the protostar formation. Reflecting the\nthermodynamics of the collapsing gas, the first core is much more massive than\nthe protostar. When the molecular cloud has no angular momentum, the first core\nfalls onto the protostar and disappears a few years after the protostar\nformation. On the other hand, when the molecular cloud has an angular momentum,\nthe first core does not disappear even after the protostar formation, and\ndirectly evolves into the circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. There\nare two paths for the formation of the circumstellar disk. When the initial\ncloud has a considerably small rotational energy, two nested disks appear just\nafter the protostar formation. During the early main accretion phase, the inner\ndisk increases its size and merges with the outer disk (i.e. first core) to\nform a single circumstellar disk with a Keplerian rotation. On the other hand,\nwhen the molecular cloud has a rotational energy comparable to observations, a\nsingle Keplerian disk that corresponds to the first core already exists prior\nto the protostar formation. In such a cloud, the first core density gradually\nincreases, maintaining the Keplerian rotation and forms the protostar inside\nit. Thus, the protostar is born in the Keplerian disk. In other words, a\nmassive disk already exists before the protostar formation. In each case, the\nprotostar at its formation is already surrounded by a massive circumstellar\ndisk. The circumstellar disk is about 10-100 times more massive than the\nprotostar in the main accretion disk.

Their\norigin is then a corrugation of the boundary between an overturning convective\nflow inside the filament and the magnetic field wrapping around it. The outward\npropagation is a combination of a pattern motion due to the downflow observed\nalong the sides of bright filaments, and the Evershed flow. The observed short\nwavelength of the striation argues against the existence of a dynamically\nsignificant horizontal field inside the bright filaments.

Our analysis\nincludes: (1) comparisons in morphology between the four IRAC bands (3.6, 4.5,\n5.8 and 8.0 um), and H2 1-0 S(1) at 2.12 um for three out of six objects; (2)\nmeasurements of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at selected positions; and\n(3) comparisons of these results with calculations of thermal H2 emission at\nLTE (207 lines in four bands) and non-LTE (32-45 lines, depending on particle\nfor collisions). We show that the morphologies observed at 3.6 and 4.5 um are\nsimilar to each other, and to H2 1-0 S(1). This is well explained by thermal H2\nemission at non-LTE if the dissociation rate is significantly larger than\n0.002-0.02, allowing thermal collisions to be dominated by atomic hydrogen. In\ncontrast, the 5.8 and 8.0 um emission shows different morphologies from the\nothers in some regions. This emission appears to be more enhanced at the wakes\nin bow shocks, or less enhanced in patchy structures in the jet. These\ntendencies are explained by the fact that thermal H2 emission in the 5.8 and\n8.0 um band is enhanced in regions at lower densities and temperatures.\nThroughout, the observed similarities and differences in morphology between\nfour bands and 1-0 S(1) are well explained by thermal H2 emission. The observed\nSEDs are categorized into:- (A) those in which the flux monotonically increases\nwith wavelength; and (B) those with excess emission at 4.5-um. The type-A SEDs\nare explained by thermal H2 emission, in particular with simple shock models\nwith a power-law cooling function. Our calculations suggest that the type-B\nSEDs require extra contaminating emission in the 4.5-um band. The CO\nvibrational emission is the most promising candidate, and the other\ncontaminants discussed to date are not likely to explain the observed SEDs.\n", "authors": "Michihiro Takami, Jennifer L.

The center height h(t) and radial expansion\nr(t) of the cavity are obtained in the whole height range of the main\nacceleration. We interpret them as the axis height and as a quantity\nproportional to the minor radius of a flux rope, respectively. The\nthree-dimensional expansion of the CME exhibits two phases in the course of its\nmain upward acceleration. From the first h and r data points, taken shortly\nafter the onset of the main acceleration, the erupting flux shows an\noverexpansion compared to its rise, as expressed by the decrease of the aspect\nratio from k=h/r ~ 3 to k ~ (1.5-2.0). This phase is approximately coincident\nwith the impulsive rise of the acceleration and is followed by a phase of very\ngradual change of the aspect ratio (a nearly self-similar expansion) toward k ~\n1.5 at h ~ 10 Rs. The initial overexpansion of the CME cavity can be caused by\nflux conservation around a rising flux rope of decreasing axial current and by\nthe addition of flux to a growing, or even newly forming,flux rope by magnetic\nreconnection. Further analysis will be required to decide which of these\ncontributions is dominant. The data also suggest that the horizontal component\nof the impulsive cavity expansion (parallel to the solar surface) triggers the\nassociated EUV wave, which subsequently detaches from the CME volume.\n", "authors": "S.

Observationally, white light observations\nhave recorded many occurrences of a thin ray appearing behind a CME eruption\nthat closely resembles a post-CME CS in its spatial correspondence and\nmorphology. UV and X-ray observations further strengthen this interpretation by\nthe observations of high temperature emission at locations consistent with\nmodel predictions. The next question then becomes whether the properties inside\na post-CME CS predicted by a model agree with observed properties. In this\nwork, we assume that the post-CME CS is a consequence of Petschek-like\nreconnection and that the observed ray-like structure is bounded by a pair of\nslow mode shocks developed from the reconnection site. We perform\ntime-dependent ionization calculations and model the UV line emission. We find\nthat such a model is consistent with SOHO/UVCS observations of the post-CME CS.\nThe change of Fe XVIII emission in one event implies an inflow speed of ~10\nkm/s and a corresponding reconnection rate of M_A ~ 0.01.

Since Algols are eclipsing binaries the\ndistribution of their orbital periods is precisely known. The distribution of\ntheir mass ratios contains however more uncertainties. We try to reproduce\nthese two distributions theoretically using a liberal scenario in which the\ngainer star can lose mass into interstellar space as a consequence of its rapid\nrotation and the energy of a hot spot. In a recent paper (Van Rensbergen et al.\n2010, A&A) we calculated the liberal evolution of binaries with a B-type\nprimary at birth where mass transfer starts during core hydrogen burning of the\ndonor. In this paper we include the cases where mass transfer starts during\nhydrogen shell burning and it is our aim to reproduce the observed\ndistributions of the system parameters of Algol-type semi-detached systems. Our\ncalculations reveal the amount of time that an Algol binary lives with a well\ndefined value of mass ratio and orbital period. We use these data to simulate\nthe distribution of mass ratios and orbital periods of Algols. Binaries with a\nlate B-type initial primary hardly lose any mass whereas those with an early B\nprimary evolve in a non-conservative way. Conservative binary evolution\npredicts only ~ 12 % of Algols with a mass ratio q above 0.4.

We considered both clumps of equal mass and\ngaussian distributions of masses, and either uniform or spatially-varying gas\ndensities. In all cases, the sink mass function develops a power law tail at\nhigh masses, with $dN/dlog M \\propto M^{-\\Gamma}$. The accretion rates of\nindividual sinks follow $\\dot{M} \\propto M^2$ at high masses; this results in a\ncontinual flattening of the slope of the mass function towards an asymptotic\nform $\\Gamma \\sim 1$ (where the Salpeter slope is $\\Gamma = 1.35$).

Now, many millions of years later, the primary is an unseen\nwhite dwarf and the secondary has itself evolved into a giant which displays\nabsorption lines of barium in its spectrum and is what we call a barium star. A\nsimilar wind-accretion mechanism is also thought to form the low-metallicity CH\nand carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.

The full width at zero intensity of Halpha\nwas 12,000 km/s at maximum, and declined linearly in time with a slope very\nsimilar to that observed in U Sco. We infer a WD mass close to the\nChandrasekhar limit and a possible final fate as a SNIa.

GOES soft X-ray images provide\nthe most likely signature of two interacting loops and their reconnection,\nwhich triggers the solar flare. TRACE 195 A images also reveal the loop-loop\ninteraction and the formation of `X' points with converging motion (~30 km/s)\nat the reconnection site in-between this interacting loop system. This provides\nthe evidence of progressive reconnection and flare maximization at the\ninteraction site in the active region. The absence of type III radio burst\nduring this time period indicates no opening of magnetic field lines during the\nflare energy release, which implies only the change of field lines\nconnectivity/orientation during the loop-loop interaction and reconnection\nprocess. The Ondrejov dynamic radio spectrum shows an intense decimetric (DCIM)\nradio burst (2.5--4.5 GHz, duration ~3 min) during flare initiation, which\nreveals the signature of particle acceleration from the reconnection site\nduring loop-loop interaction. The double peak structures at 4.9 and 8.8 GHz\nprovide the most likely confirmatory signature of the loop-loop interaction at\nthe flare site in the active region. RHESSI hard X-ray images also show the\nloop-top and footpoint sources of the corresponding two loop system and their\ncoalescence during the flare maximum, which act like the current carrying\nflux-tubes with resultant opposite magnetic fields and the net force of\nattraction. We also suggest that the shear motion/rotation of the footpoint of\nthe smaller loop, which is anchored in the opposite polarity spot, may be\nresponsible for the flare energy buildup and then its release due to the\nloop-loop interaction.\n", "authors": "Pankaj Kumar, A.

Here we use a quantitative analysis of the rapid optical brightness\nvariations from this companion, Mira B, which we observed with the Nickel\ntelescope at Lick Observatory, to show that it is a white dwarf (WD). The\namplitude of aperiodic optical variations on time scales of minutes to tens of\nminutes (approximately 0.2 mag) is consistent with that of accreting WDs in\ncataclysmic variables on these same time scales. It is significantly greater\nthan that expected from an accreting main-sequence star.

We do not find any evidence that the accretion\nrate is higher than predicted by Bondi-Hoyle theory. The accretion rate is high\nenough, however, to explain the weak X-ray emission, since the accretion-disk\nboundary layer around a low-mass WD accreting at this rate is likely to be\noptically thick and therefore to emit primarily in the far or extreme UV.\nFurthermore, the finding that Mira B is a WD means that it has experienced, and\nwill continue to experience nova explosions, roughly every million years.

The\nphotometric behavior of M31-RV (and several other very red novae, i.e. luminous\neruptive red variables) has led to several models of this apparently new class\nof astrophysical object. One of the most detailed models is that of\n\"mergebursts\": hypothetical mergers of close binary stars. These are predicted\nto rival or exceed the brightest classical novae in luminosity, but to be much\ncooler and redder than classical novae, and to become slowly hotter and bluer\nas they age. This prediction suggests two stringent and definitive tests of the\nmergeburst hypothesis. First, there should always be a cool red remnant, and\nNOT a hot blue remnant at the site of such an outburst. Second, the inflated\nenvelope of a mergeburst event should be slowly contracting, hence it must\ndisplay a slowly rising effective temperature. We have located a luminous,\nUV-bright object within 0.4 arcsec (1.5 sigma of the astrometric position) of\nM31-RV in archival WFPC2 images taken 10 years after the outburst: it resembles\nan old nova. Twenty years after the outburst, the object remains much too hot\nto be a mergeburst. Its behavior remains consistent with that of theoretical\nnova models which erupt on a low mass white dwarf.

As had been reported earlier, we find that it is\nrelatively easy to get very precise values of stellar radii using grid-based\ntechniques. However, we find that there are small, but significant, biases that\ncan result because of the grid of models used. The biases can be minimized if\nmetallicity is known. Masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii,\nand suffer from larger systematic effects. We also find that the errors in mass\nand radius are correlated. A positive consequence of this correlation is that\nlog g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost no systematic\nbiases. Radii and log g can be determined with almost no model dependence to\nwithin 5% for realistic estimates of error in asteroseismic and conventional\nobservations. Errors in mass can be somewhat higher unless accurate metallicity\nestimates are available. Age estimates of individual stars are the most model\ndependent. The errors are larger too.

The\nfact that the outbursting star is in the middle of an old planetary nebula and\nthat the ejecta associated with the outburst is hydrogen deficient supports\nthis diagnosis. However, the material ejected during that outburst is also\nextremely neon rich, suggesting that it derives from an oxygen-neon-magnesium\nstar, as is the case in the so-called neon novae. We have therefore attempted\nto construct a scenario that explains all the observations of the nebula and\nits central star, including the ejecta abundances. We find two scenarios that\nhave the potential to explain the observations, although neither is a perfect\nmatch. The first scenario invokes the merger of a main sequence star and a\nmassive oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf. The second invokes an\noxygen-neon-magnesium classical nova that takes place shortly after a final\nhelium shell flash. The main drawback of the first scenario is the inability to\ndetermine whether the ejecta would have the observed composition and whether a\nmerger could result in the observed hydrogen-deficient stellar abundances\nobserved in the star today. The second scenario is based on better understood\nphysics, but, through a population synthesis technique, we determine that its\nfrequency of occurrence should be very low and possibly lower than what is\nimplied by the number of observed systems. While we could not envisage a\nscenario that naturally explains this object, this is the second final flash\nstar which, upon closer scrutiny, is found to have hydrogen-deficient ejecta\nwith abnormally high neon abundances.

These channels include binaries in which the exploding\nwhite dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (DDS, SDS, and helium-rich\ndonor scenario) as well as the sub-Chandrasekhar mass scenario, in which a\nwhite dwarf accretes from a helium-rich companion and explodes as a SN Ia\nbefore reaching the Chandrasekhar mass limit.

The model is then applied to four individual stars\nincluding two moderate and two fast rotators to reproduce their observed\ndifferential rotation quite closely. A series of models for rapidly rotating\n($P_{rot} = 1$ day) stars of different masses and compositions is generated.\nThe effective temperature is found convenient to parameterize the differential\nrotation: variations with metallicity, that are quite pronounced when the\ndifferential rotation is considered as a function of the stellar mass, almost\ndisappear in the dependence of differential rotation on temperature. The\ndifferential rotation increases steadily with surface temperature to exceed the\nlargest differential rotation observed to date for the hottest F-stars we\nconsidered. This strong differential rotation is, however, found not to be\nefficient for dynamos when the efficiency is estimated with the standard\n$C_\\Omega$-parameter of dynamo models.

The\nimplications of the change of the flow structure for stellar dynamos are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "authors": "L. L. Kitchatinov, S. V.
